##  Seção 27.2 Condução de Vozes Successive Seventh Acordes

Sometimes you will encounter a situation where there are successive seventh acordes. This is especially the case in circle of fifth progressions. When condução de vozes a circle of fifths progressão with root position seventh acordes in four parts (SATB), alternate between incomplete seventh acordes (without the fifth of the acorde) and complete seventh acordes, as can be seen in the example below from Vivaldi’s Concerto for Two Violins and Cello in D minor, RV 565.
