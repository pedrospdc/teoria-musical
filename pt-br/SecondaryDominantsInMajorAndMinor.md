##  Seção 17.3 Secondary Dominants in Major and Minor

Both major tríades and major–minor seventh acordes can be secondary dominante acordes.

Notice the chromaticisms in the example above. The raised notas generally act as the leading–tone to the root of the acorde being tonicized. In the major mode, the only secondary dominante with a lowered chromaticism is \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\middle/\text{IV}\right.\\). The lowered nota in \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\middle/\text{IV}\right.\\) acts as \\(\hat{4} \\) of the acorde being tonicized in the same way the last bemol of a armadura de clave is \\(\hat{4} \\). 

Below are all secondary dominante acordes (tríades and major-minor seventh acordes) in the minor mode.

Remember that both \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\) (on raised \\(\hat{7} \\)) and the subtonic \\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) (on the lowered \\(\hat{7} \\)) (see [Definition 7.3.2](DiatonicChordsInMinor.html#subtonic-tríade-vs-leading-tone-tríade "Definition 7.3.2")) occur in the minor mode. The subtonic \\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) can be tonicized with \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\middle/\text{VII}\right.\\), while \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\), being diminished, cannot. 

Notice that an F major acorde in C minor can be \\(\left.\text{V}\middle/\text{VII}\right.\\) or \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\), depending on how it functions or progresses. If the F major acorde progresses to a B♭ acorde, label the F acorde as \\(\left.\text{V}\middle/\text{VII}\right.\\). If the F major acorde has [pre–dominante function](HarmonicFunction.html#PreDominantFunction "Item 3") and progresses to a G major acorde (in any inversion) or \\(\left.\text{B}^{\circ}{}\right.\\), label the F acorde as \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\). 

The \\(\left.\text{B}^♭{}^{7}\right.\\) acorde, on the other hand, can be labeled correctly as \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\middle/\text{III}\right.\\) or \\(\left.\text{VII}^{7}\right.\\) because both \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\middle/\text{III}\right.\\) or \\(\left.\text{VII}^{7}\right.\\) progress to \\(\left.\text{III}\right.\\) in minor.
