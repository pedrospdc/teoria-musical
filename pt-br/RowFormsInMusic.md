Rows may also be presented contrapuntally or harmonically. In the example below, the row is separated into three tetracordes and presented contrapuntally.

In the final example in this section, the two rows are presenting in melody-accompaniment texture, with P\\(\text{}_{0}\\) containing the melody and R\\(\text{}_{0}\\) occurring as acordes.
