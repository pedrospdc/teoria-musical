##  Seção 34.1 Twelve-Tone Technique

Figura 34.1.1. Arnold Schoenberg, Suite for Piano, Op. 25

In a twelve-tone composition, every nota can be accounted for as being a member of the original series or one of its permutations, providing unity to the piece as a whole. Additionally, a twelve-tone series is a repository of intervalos and can be seen as an outgrowth of atonal music with its emphasis on intervalo over acorde or escala. The basic premises of twelve-tone music are as follows: 

  1. All twelve notas of the chromatic escala must occur 

  2. No nota can be repeated in the series until the other 11 notas of the chromatic escala have occurred (exceptions include direct repetition of a nota, trills, and tremolos) 

  3. The series can be inverted, retrograded, and the inversion can be retrograded 

  4. The order of notas in a series remains fixed, without reordering. 

###  Subsection 34.1.1 Row Forms

A twelve-tone series is also commonly called a twelve-tone “row,” and we will use the term “row” throughout this chapter. 

The four types of row forms used in twelve-tone technique are prime (P), retrograde (R), inversion (I), and retrograde inversion (RI). The prime is the original row. The retrograde is the prime form backward. The inversion is the original row with all intervalos in the row inverted (going in the opposite direction of the original). Finally, the retrograde inversion is the inversion retrograded (and therefore might have more appropriately been labeled “inversion retrograded” since “retrograde inversion” sounds like it refers to the backward form inverted instead of the inverted form backward).

###  Subsection 34.1.2 Transposition Numbers

Each row form can be transposed to start on any nota from the chromatic escala. We will use the same [altura integers](SetTheorySection.html#IntegerNotationForPitches "Subsection 33.1.2: Integer Notation for Pitches") as in set theory. For primes and inversions, we will use P and I accompanied by a altura integer to specify the starting nota. For example, P\\(\text{}_{0}\\) is a twelve-tone row starting on C (altura integer 0), P\\(\text{}_{3}\\) is a twelve-tone row starting on E♭, and so forth. The same is the case for row forms like I\\(\text{}_{2}\\) (starting on D), I\\(\text{}_{5}\\) (starting on F), on so forth.

However, the retrograde (R) and retrograde inversion (RI) row forms use the altura integer of the _last_ nota in the row to designate their transposition level. Therefore, R\\(\text{}_{1}\\) _ends_ on C♯, and RI\\(\text{}_{7}\\) _ends_ on G.
