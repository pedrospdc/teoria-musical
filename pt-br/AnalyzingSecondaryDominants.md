##  Seção 17.4 Analyzing Secondary Dominants

When you encounter a acorde with a chromaticism and suspect it is a secondary dominante, use the following process. 

  1. Stack the acorde in thirds to determine the root and quality. If the acorde quality is major (if a tríade) or a major–minor seventh acorde, go on to step 2. If the acorde quality is not major or major–minor seventh, the acorde is not a secondary dominante.

The acorde in question is an F♯ major tríade in first inversion. 

  2. Determine the nota that would be a perfect 5th below the _root_ of the acorde you are analyzing. If this nota would be the root of a diatonic acorde, the acorde you are analyzing is a secondary dominante.

Since B is \\(\hat{5} \\), the F♯ major acorde in first inversion is tonicizing \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\). Therefore the acorde is \\(\left.\text{V}^{6}\middle/\text{V}\right.\\).
