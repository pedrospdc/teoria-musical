##  Seção 30.7 Invention Expositions

J.S. Bach’s Two-Part Inventions were not only intended as instructional teclado pieces but also as examples of how to compose. In this section we will wed our species contraponto knowledge with our knowledge of harmony in order to write a four-compasso invention exposition using Bach’s C major and E minor inventions as models. Nota the I–I–V–V–I harmonic progressão.

###  Subsection 30.7.1 How to Write an Invention Exposition

In the majority of examples, you will be given an invention theme in the first compasso, which you will write an oitava inferior in the bass part in the second compasso, then a perfect fifth higher than the first compasso in the third compasso, the fourth compasso will be the third compasso transposed down one oitava, and, finally, you will end on the intervalo of a 10th—tônica in the bass part and \\(\hat{3} \\) in the superior part. Please see the example below.

###  Subsection 30.7.2 Altering Themes to Fit the Harmonies

  1. You may find that a theme that leads naturally from I to V needs its contour altered _when progressing from V to I in compassos 4 to 5_ in order to emphasize the V acorde and the dominante-to-tônica harmonic motion. Modify the contour to emphasize the V acorde at the end of the compasso, altering as few notas as possible.

  2. Additionally, you may be given themes that land on \\(\hat{3} \\) on the downbeat of the second compasso, not the \\(\hat{5} \\) that occurred in the Bach C major and E minor invention expositions. You will need to alter the theme at the end of compasso 2 to emphasize the I acorde as well as make the first bass nota of the third compasso the \\(\hat{5} \\) escala degree.

  3. Finally, when a theme in minor containing the \\(\hat{2} \\) and \\(\hat{3} \\) escala degrees in the first two compassos is transposed up a fifth in the succeeding two compassos, escala degrees \\(\hat{2} \\) and ♭\\(\hat{3} \\) _will be transposed to ↑ \\(\hat{6} \\) and ↑\\(\hat{7} \\)_. The reasoning is that ↑\\(\hat{7} \\) is the 3rd of the V acorde, and ↑\\(\hat{6} \\) is a step below, typically a passing tone. Another way to think of this is to _use the melodic escala menor in the 3rd and 4th measures_.

###  Subsection 30.7.3 Adding Contraponto to the Theme Statements

After copying and transposing the theme throughout this four-compasso invention exposition, you will need to add contraponto to accompany the statements of the theme in the second, third, and fourth compassos. Unlike species contraponto, your contraponto in these invention expositions _must emphasize the harmony_ in each compasso.

You may find the need to create “microharmonies” within a compasso with some themes, such as a I–IV–I or I–\\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{6}\right.\\)–I progressão even though the overriding harmony of the compasso is the I acorde. Examples are found in the first two compassos of the C major invention.

Given these pieces of information, you are prepared to begin writing tonal contraponto in two parts.
