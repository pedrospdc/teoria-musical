##  Seção 34.2 Determining Row Forms

To determine a row form’s permutation and transposition, examine the intervallic composition of each row form. In the example below, each row statement is based on the prime form of the row in the previous sections.

Let’s examine the starting intervalos of each row form.

In examining the first few notas in the superior pauta in the short musical excerpt below, we see an ascending minor 3rd followed by a descending major 2nd. The only row form to start with these intervalos is the retrograde. To determine the transposition number, we look at the last nota (the 12th nota) in the first compasso in the superior pauta (A♭), which gives us the transposition level (altura integer 8), meaning this is R\\(\text{}_{8}\\). The second compasso in the superior pauta begins with a minor 3rd followed by an ascending major 2nd, making this a retrograde inversion. The 12th nota in this compasso is an E (altura integer 4), making this RI\\(\text{}_{4}\\). In the first compasso of the inferior pauta, we find a descending minor 2nd followed by a descending perfect 4th, making this I\\(\text{}_{11}\\). Finally, the second compasso in the inferior pauta begins on C♯ with an ascending minor 2nd followed by an ascending perfect 4th, making this P\\(\text{}_{1}\\).
