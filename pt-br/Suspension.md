##  Seção 10.9 Suspension

Suspensions are accented non-acorde tones occurring on downbeats. A suspension is approached by the same nota and resolves down by step. A suspension is made up of a preparation, suspension, and resolution. Sometimes the preparation is tied to the suspension.

Figura 10.9.1. Introductory Suspension example with and without tie

Suspensions are classified by numbers (9-8, 7-6, 4-3, 2-3, and sometimes 6-5) that specify the intervalo distância of the suspended nota and its resolution to the bass nota

Figura 10.9.2. Examples of the 9-8, 7-6, 4-3, 2-3, and 6-5 suspensions

In the example above, the notas in the 4-3 suspension are an 11th and 10th higher than the bass. Reduce all intervalos larger than an oitava to the numbers 7-6, 4-3, and 6-5. 

Here is an example with a 4-3 suspension.

The 2-3 suspension is the “bass suspension” and is measured against an superior voice. Again, you may encounter the literal intervalos 10-9 but should label the suspension as 2-3.

When a acorde is inverted, you will sometimes encounter non-standard suspension numbers like 5-4 or 3-2.

Figura 10.9.6. Non-standard suspension numbers because of inverted acordes

You will sometimes encounter decorations of suspensions where other notas occur before the resolution, as in the following example.

Figura 10.9.7. Bach, J.S., French Suite No. 1 in D Minor, BWV 812, Sarabande (1722)

The “ret.” in the tenor part in the second compasso is a retardation, which is covered in the next section.
