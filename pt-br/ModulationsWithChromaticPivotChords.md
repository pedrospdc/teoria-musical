##  Seção 22.6 Modulations with Chromatic Pivot Acordes

You will sometimes encounter examples where the pivot acorde is a chromatic acorde in at least one (and sometimes both) of the keys involved in the modulation. 

###  Subsection 22.6.1 Secondary Common Acorde

Below is an example where the pivot acorde is a secondary acorde in both keys.

###  Subsection 22.6.2 Borrowed Common Acorde

In modulation by borrowed common acorde (or mode mixture), the pivot acorde will be a borrowed acorde in one of the keys involved in the modulation. 

In the following example, a borrowed acorde, \\(\left.\text{i}^{6}\right.\\) in D♭ major, rewritten as a C♯ minor acorde, is reinterpreted as \\(\left.\text{vi}^{6}\right.\\) in the second key, E major.

###  Subsection 22.6.3 Neapolitan Common Acorde

A particularly adventurous and imaginative pivot is the Neapolitan, which can bridge the gap between two foreign (or distantly related) keys.

Figura 22.6.3. Schubert, Schwanegesang, D. 957, “Frühlingssehnsucht” (1828)

In the example above, Schubert bridges the tonal distância between D minor and A♭ minor with \\(\left.\text{N}^{6}_{5}\right.\\) (nota the dominante-seventh quality of the Neapolitan in this instance), which acts as a \\(\left.\text{V}^{6}_{5}\right.\\) in A♭ minor, a tritone away from D minor. 

###  Subsection 22.6.4 Augmented Sixth Common Acorde

In the next chapter, we will examine how Augmented Sixth acordes are enharmonically reinterpreted in a process known as enharmonic modulation.
