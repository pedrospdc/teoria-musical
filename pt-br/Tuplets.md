##  Seção 4.5 Tuplets

Tuplet is a generic term that describes a grouping of notas that would not normally occur within a beat. 

A quarter nota naturally divides into two eighth notas or four sixteenth notas. A triplet is a grouping of three eighth notas that occurs within the span of the quarter nota. A quintuplet would be a grouping of five sixteenth notas to occur within the span of one quarter nota. It is not uncommon to see quintuplets, sextuplets, and septuplets.

If you write a piece of music that naturally has a triplet division to the beat, you should use \\(\begin{smallmatrix}6\\\8\end{smallmatrix}\\), \\(\begin{smallmatrix}9\\\8\end{smallmatrix}\\) or \\(\begin{smallmatrix}12\\\8\end{smallmatrix}\\) depending on the number of beats in each compasso.
