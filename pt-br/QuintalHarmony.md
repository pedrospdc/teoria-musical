##  Seção 32.3 Quartal, Quintal, and Secundal Harmony

Quartal harmony refers to acordes stacked entirely (or mostly) in fourths. Quintal harmony refers to acordes stacked entirely (or mostly) in fifths. Secundal harmony refers to acordes stacked entirely (or mostly) in seconds. Contrast these concepts with the tertian (stacked in thirds) harmony we’ve encountered in the majority of this text. Alternative methods of stacking acordes became more common after 1900 as composers sought ways to innovate and break with the past. 

The next three examples demonstrate quartal harmony.
