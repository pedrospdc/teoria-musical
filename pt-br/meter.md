##  Seção 4.4 Meter

Meter describes the number of beats in a compasso (also know as a “compasso”) and how the beats are normally divided. 

Beat is "[t]he basic pulse underlying measured music and thus the unit by which musical time is reckoned..." according to Barry Kernfeld in _The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz_ , 2nd edition. Pulse and beat are synonymous. 

Tempo refers to the speed of the beat or pulse. Tempo can be referred to in beats per minute (bpm), such as 60bpm (where the rate of the beat would be equal to a second), or, in classical music, with terms like Allegro, Andante, and Adagio, sometimes in combinations with "M.M." for Maelzel’s Metronome. 

Meters with two beats in a compasso are described as _duple_. If there are three beats in a compasso, the meter is described as _triple_ , and if there are four beats in a compasso, the meter is described as _quadruple_. 

If the beats are normally divided into two parts, the meter is described as simple. If the beats are normally divided into three parts, the meter is described as compound.

The fórmula de compasso \\(\begin{smallmatrix}2\\\8\end{smallmatrix}\\) is “simple duple meter.” The fórmula de compasso \\(\begin{smallmatrix}3\\\2\end{smallmatrix}\\) is “simple triple meter.” Finally, \\(\begin{smallmatrix}4\\\4\end{smallmatrix}\\) is “simple quadruple meter.” 

When describing meter, we say how the beat is divided before the number of beats in the compasso.

With compound meters the bottom number specifies _the division of the beat_. The beat value is a dotted nota. We say \\(\begin{smallmatrix}6\\\16\end{smallmatrix}\\) is “compound duple meter” because it has two beats. The fórmula de compasso \\(\begin{smallmatrix}6\\\8\end{smallmatrix}\\) is also compound duple. Compound time signatures have a top number greater than four that is divisible by 3 (6, 9, 12).

The following table summarizes meter and time signatures. 

Top number of fórmula de compasso: | 2 | 3 | 4 | = Simple  
---|---|---|---|---  
Top number of fórmula de compasso: | 6 | 9 | 12 | = Compound  
Number of beats: | Duple | Triple | Quadruple |
