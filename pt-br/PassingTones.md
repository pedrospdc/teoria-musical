In the first compasso of the “Want to Want Me” example, the passing tone is unaccented. In the third compasso, it is accented (on the beat). The non-acorde tone in compasso 2 is an [appoggiatura](Appoggiatura.html "Seção 10.4: Appoggiatura"). 

There can be two consecutive diatonic passing tones in a descending escala segment from the root and fifth of a acorde.
