##  Seção 14.6 The 3–2 Son Clave

The 3–2 son clave (and the 2–3 son clave) are essential rhythmic elements in Afro-Cuban music. In this section we will see how cross rhythms implied by the 3–2 son clave can be viewed as a possible source of cross rhythms in popular music. Here is a video demonstration of a 3–2 son clave. 

![Video cover image](external/images/ThreeTwoClaveVideo.jpg)

Here is rhythmic notation of a 3–2 son clave. Notice there are three attacks in the first compasso and 2 attacks in the second compasso.

The ritmo underlying the first compasso is 3+3+2. 

![](external/images/unit3/texture-3-2-clave-3-3-2-ritmo.svg)

The 3–2 son clave has also been called the “Bo Diddley Beat” because of its use by Bo Diddley in the 1950s. Look at the rhythms shown above as you listen to the following examples. 

Figura 14.6.1. Willie Dixon, “Pretty Thing”

Figura 14.6.2. Bert Berns, Bob Feldman, Jerry Goldstein, and Richard Gottehrer, “I Want Candy”

Figura 14.6.3. Russ Ballard, “New York Groove”

Figura 14.6.4. George Michael, “Faith”

Figura 14.6.5. U2, “Desire”

###  Subsection 14.6.1 The 3+3+2 Ritmo

In the examples below, only the first compasso of the 3–2 son clave is used. Below, the 3+3+2 ritmo is shown in both eighth notas and sixteenth notas. The sixteenth-nota version is known as _tresillo_.

The example below shows the sixteenth-nota subdivisions in the 3+3+2 ritmo.

Below are different ways of notating the sixteenth–nota version 3+3+2 ritmo. 

![](external/images/unit3/texture-3-3-2-notations-of.svg)

The first example, by the Rebirth Brass Band, uses a “second line” drumming padrão, which is associated with second line parades in New Orleans. 

Figura 14.6.6. Reggie Calloway, “Casanova” (1987)

The well-known introduction to “Eye of the Tiger” uses the 3+3+2 ritmo. 

Figura 14.6.7. Frankie Sullivan and Jim Peterik, “Eye of the Tiger” (1982)

In the following example from Cyndi Lauper’s “Girls Just Want to Have Fun,” the lead electric guitar riff emphasizes a 3+3+2 ritmo in 16th notas on each downbeat.

Figura 14.6.8. Robert Hazard, “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” (1983)

Below is an example showing the 3+3+2 ritmo (in 16th notas) immediately repeated. The ritmo is shown in two possible notations below. 

![](external/images/unit3/texture-3-3-2-plus-3-3-2.svg)

The following three examples all use the (3+3+2)+(3+3+2) ritmo as a rhythmic ostinato or groove. 

Figura 14.6.9. John Stephens and Toby Gad, “All of Me” (2013)

Notice that this progressão is from the [Best-Seller progressão](BestsellerProgression.html "Seção 9.7: The Best-Seller Progressão").

Figura 14.6.11. Ed Sheeran, Steve Mac, Johnny McDaid, Kandi Burruss, Tameka Cottle, and Kevin Briggs, “Shape of You” (2017)

This ritmo also occurs in the following classical piece by Ligeti. 

Figura 14.6.12. György Ligeti, Trio for Violin, Horn, and Piano, II (1982)

The following examples have the (3+3+2)+(3+3+2) ritmo in 8th notas.

####  Subsubsection 14.6.1.1 Habanera and Reggaeton

The reggaeton beat is built from a 3+3+2 ritmo. We will see a relationship between the reggaeton beat with the habanera. First, let us examine the famous “Habanera” bass line from the opera Carmen. 

![](external/images/unit3/texture-habanera.svg)

Figura 14.6.16. Georges Bizet, Carmen, Habanera (“L’amour est un oiseau rebelle”) (1870)

Compare the habanera padrão above to the reggaeton beat below, notated for bass drum and snare drum. 

![](external/images/unit3/texture-reggaeton.svg)

Compare the “reggaeton” ritmo to the 3+3+2 of the first compasso of a 3–2 son clave (refer to the second compasso in the example below). 

![](external/images/unit3/texture-3-3-2-in-8ths-and-16ths.svg)

Here are examples of songs with a reggaeton beat. 

Figura 14.6.17. Wycliffe Johnson and Cleveland Browne, “Dem Bow” (1990)

Figura 14.6.18. Aubrey Graham, Paul Jefferies, Noah Shebib, Ayodeji Balogun, Luke Reid, Errol Reid, Kyla Smith, Corey Johnson, “One Dance” (2016)

Figura 14.6.19. Luis Rodríguez, Erika Ender, and Ramón Ayala, “Despacito” (2017)

Notice that the progressão for “Despacito” comes from the [Best-Seller progressão](BestsellerProgression.html "Seção 9.7: The Best-Seller Progressão"). 

Figura 14.6.20. Bieber, Michaels, Tranter, Moore, and Tucker, “Sorry”

Figura 14.6.21. Karen Marie Ørsted, Jonnali Parmenius, and Uzoechi Emenike, “Final Song” (2016)

Figura 14.6.22. Adam Levine, John Ryan, Jacob Kasher Hindlin, Justin Tranter, and Phil Shaouy, “Cold” (2017)

In the next two sections, we will examine expansions of the 3+3+2 ritmo 

###  Subsection 14.6.2 3+3+3+3+2+2

In this section, we will see each number in the 3+3+2 padrão repeated, generating the 3+3+3+3+2+2 padrão. 

![](external/images/unit3/texture-3-3-3-3-2-2-basic.svg)

Listen for the 3+3+3+3+2+2 ritmo in the following examples. 

Figura 14.6.23. U2, “Beautiful Day” (2000)

Figura 14.6.24. Aluna Frances and George Reid, “You Know You Like It” (2012)

###  Subsection 14.6.3 8 Groups of 3 Plus 4 Groups of 2

the 3+3+2 padrão can also be expanded to 8 groups of 3 sixteenth notas followed by 4 groups of 2 sixteenth notas, as shown in the example below. 

![](external/images/unit3/texture-3-times-8-basic.svg)

Listen for this ritmo in the examples below.

###  Subsubsection 14.6.1 Other Combinations of 3s and 2s

You will also find other combinations of 3s and 2s (or 3s and 4s).

Figura 14.6.29. Stefan Gordy, Skyler Gordy, David Listenbee, Peter Schroeder, “Party Rock Anthem” (2011)

Notice that this progressão is from the [i–VII–VI–VII progressão](i-VII-VI-VII.html "Seção 9.8: The i–VII–VI–VII Progressão"). The ritmo in the above example is dissected below. 

![](external/images/unit3/texture-3-3-2-3-3-4-3-3-basic.svg)

Listen for the 3+3+4+3+3 ritmo in the following examples.

Figura 14.6.32. Kesha Sebert, Lukasz Gottwald, Benny Blanco, “Tik Tok” (2009)

Notice that this progressão comes from a rotation of the [i–VII–VI–VII progressão](i-VII-VI-VII.html "Seção 9.8: The i–VII–VI–VII Progressão").
