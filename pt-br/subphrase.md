##  Seção 11.5 Subphrase

Subphrases are smaller than phrases but larger than motives. Most of the subphrases we encounter will be two compassos long. Subphrases are called “phrase segments” and “phrase members” in other texts. 

We will label subphrases with letters (_a,_ _b,_ etc.). When a subphrase repeats but has slight alterations, we will put an apostrophe after the letter (e.g., _a’_) and refer to it as “a prime.” If another alteration to subphrase a occurs, we will label it as _a’’_ and refer to it as “a double prime.” If the subphrase is merely transposed (in a sequence), we will label it as _a,_ not _a’_ in our analysis. 

We are including analysis of subphrases in this text because many compositions have melodic units that are two compassos long. Analyzing subphrases helps us understand the construction of melodies. 

In the following example, notice that subphrases _a_ and _a’_ have the same first six notas (\\(\text{G}^♯\\)–\\(\text{F}^♯\\)–\\(\text{B}\\)–\\(\text{C}^♯\\)–\\(\text{E}\\)–\\(\text{E}\\)).

Here is an example of a four-compasso phrase with subphrases _a_ and _b_.

Notice that we are not looking at the motives within these subphrases. This is because we are looking for melodic segments that are repeated. For some compositions it is more informative to look at subphrases and less informative to identify motives if motives are not extracted and developed. 

There will be times when you will notice important melodic ideas happening at three levels of analysis (motive, subphrase, and phrase), as in the following example.

There is ambiguity between motive and subphrase. Reconsider the following example from the section on intervallic change:

Figura 11.5.4. Ray Noble, “The Very Thought of You” (1934)

When you listen to the music of “The Very Thought of You” you will hear that each motive lasts for two compassos. The difference is that motives are typically short—two to seven notas—whereas subphrases will usually contain six or more notas and occupy two compassos (half of a four-compasso phrase).
