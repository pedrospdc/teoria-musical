##  Seção 22.5 How to Recognize a Key After a Modulation

Look for the following cues when examining music containing modulations: 

  1. Look for recurring acidentes, then add them to the armadura de clave to determine the new key

     1. Lowered notas (like flats) usually create \\(\hat{4} \\) (as do the flats in armaduras de clave) 

     2. Raised notas (like sharps) often create \\(\hat{7} \\), the leading tone

        1. If there are multiple raised notas, look for the “sharpest of sharps” (in armadura de clave order) to determine which sustenido is acting as \\(\hat{7} \\)

  2. If acidentes are canceled out, they indicate tonicizations or chromatic non-acorde tones
