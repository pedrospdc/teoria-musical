##  Seção 23.2 The V7 and Ger+6 as Pivot Acordes

In this first type of enharmonic modulation, the pivot to the new key will consist of the \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\) being enharmonically reinterpreted as a \\(\left.\text{Ger}^{+6}\right.\\), or the \\(\left.\text{Ger}^{+6}\right.\\) being enharmonically reinterpreted as \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\). Secondary dominants, like \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\middle/\text{IV}\right.\\), \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\middle/\text{V}\right.\\), etc., will also be reinterpreted harmonically as \\(\left.\text{Ger}^{+6}\right.\\) acordes (and vice versa) in enharmonic modulations. 

As we saw in the previous section, the dominante seventh acorde and the \\(\left.\text{Ger}^{+6}\right.\\) acorde have the same sound but are spelled differently. This involves a fairly straightforward enharmonic respelling. Most commonly, the top nota of the acorde is enharmonically respelled to envision the enharmonic alternative.

Each acorde above implies a key based on its spelling: the dominante seventh acorde occurs diatonically only on the \\(\hat{5} \\) escala degree in major, while the \\(\left.\text{Ger}^{+6}\right.\\) acorde most commonly occurs with the lowest nota on the lowered \\(\hat{6} \\) escala degree. 

Less commonly, the bottom three notas could be respelled and the uppermost nota could be retained as a common tone.

Remember, you will not see this respelling in the music you are analyzing. You must be able to visualize the enharmonic respelling in order to analyze the enharmonic modulation correctly. 

The examples below illustrate some of the ways this enharmonic modulation occurs in pieces from the literature 

In the first example from Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker ballet, a \\(\left.\text{D}^{7}\right.\\) is spelled na pauta as D–F♯–A–B♯ so that it sounds like a \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\middle/\text{IV}\right.\\) in D major but is spelled and resolves as a \\(\left.\text{Ger}^{+6}\right.\\) in the key of F♯ minor.

In the following example from the second movement of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, the same pivot acordes are used as in the example above—\\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\middle/\text{IV}\right.\\) in A♭ major is enharmonically respelled and resolves as a \\(\left.\text{Ger}^{+6}\right.\\) in C major.

In the following example from Les Miserables, a \\(\left.\text{Ger}^{+6}\right.\\) in E minor is spelled as a \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\) acorde in F major and resolves to the I acorde F major.

In the next section we will examine how the fully diminished seventh acorde can be enharmonically reinterpreted.
