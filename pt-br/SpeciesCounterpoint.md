##  Seção 30.1 Species Contraponto

The seminal composition text, Gradus ad Parnassum (1725), by Johann Joseph Fux, teaches contrapuntal composition through “species contraponto.” Species contraponto uses simple rhythmic values and teaches composers how to write one, two, three, or four notas against a larger value, usually a whole nota. In this text, we will focus on writing for two voices. In a semester-long college course in contraponto, one typically learns to write for up to four voices. 

Contraponto can be thought of as the simultaneous sounding of two or more melodic lines. An example is shown below.

Textures made of contraponto are called “contrapuntal” and can be contrasted with melody-accompaniment textures, which are called “homophonic.”
