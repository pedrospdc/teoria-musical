_Articulation_ | Generally legato   
_Dynamics_ | Soft  
_Register_ | Neither extremely high nor low

The following elements are noticeably changed: 

Tabela 15.2.6. C Seção, Second Movement, Eine kleine Nachtmusik

_Harmony_ | This section begins in C minor   
---|---  
_Rhythm_ | The accompaniment moves in 16th notas and the ornamentation of the second melody nota (the turn) in the outer parts sounds as four 32nd notas   
_Texture_ | The middle two parts (Violin II and Viola) are paired together and the Violin I and Cello/Bass part engage in imitation   
_Articulation_ | The middle parts are played in a “separated” manner (more staccato than legato) and the motive in the outer voices starts with a staccato nota   
  
Listen to how Mozart puts the entire form together, including transitional material to smooth out the changes from one section to another.
