##  Seção 26.6 Rules of Spacing

Generally, the superior three voice parts (soprano, alto, and tenor) are kept close together. The general rule of spacing is to keep the distância between soprano and alto as well as the distância between alto to tenor within an oitava of each other. Allowing a distância greater than an oitava between soprano and alto (or between alto and tenor) is considered spacing error. The distância from the bass to the tenor can be greater than an oitava.

In terms of spacing acordes, one should consider the spacing that occurs in the overtone series.

Larger spaces between notas occur inferior in the overtone series. Consider the voicings of the following acordes. Some “ring” or resonate better than others. Notice that all of the notas fall within the voice ranges specified [above](VoiceRanges.html "Seção 26.4: Voice Ranges").
