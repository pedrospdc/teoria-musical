##  Seção 29.1 Condução de Vozes Secondary Acordes

When condução de vozes secondary acordes, one largely follows condução de vozes rules for seventh acordes: 

  1. Resolve the 7th of a acorde down by step.

  2. Alternate complete voicings with incomplete voicings when condução de vozes [successive root position seventh acordes](SuccessiveSeventhChords.html#successive-seventh-acordes-principle "Principle 27.2.2: Condução de Vozes Successive Root Position 7th acordes") . Nota that with secondary acordes, the 3rd of the acorde, typically a raised nota, will resolve down by semitom to the 7th of the next acorde, which is a diatonic nota that cancels out the chromaticism of the previous nota.

  3. Follow the [principle](SpecialResolutionOfVII7.html "Seção 27.4: The Special Resolution of vii\\\(\\left.\\text{}^{\\circ}{}^{7}\\right.\\\) \(and vii\\\(\\left.\\text{}^ø{}^{7}\\right.\\\)\)") for resolving \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\\) and \\(\left.\text{vii}^ø{}^{7}\right.\\) when dealing with secondary \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\\) and \\(\left.\text{vii}^ø{}^{7}\right.\\) acordes.

     1. An important exception occurs when \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{7}\middle/\text{V}\right.\\) or \\(\left.\text{vii}^ø{}^{7}\middle/\text{V}\right.\\) resolves to V. If the melody requires the 7th of the acorde to be voiced above the 3rd of the acorde, solve the example by writing parallel (unequal) fifths instead of the doubling of the leading tone, which is considered less acceptable.
