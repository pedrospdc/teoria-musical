##  Seção 13.2 The Sentence

A sentence in music _is a phrase_ with a specific melodic construction: a melodic idea (motive 1 or subphrase a) is either repeated or sequenced then followed by either related or unrelated material leading to a cadência. 

In this first example, Mozart sequences motive 1 from compasso 1 down a step in compasso 2. Compasso 3 contains related material and compasso 4 contains cadential material.

In the next example, Beethoven changes the intervalos of subphrase a in compassos 3–4 to fit the dominante harmony. He extracts motive 2 from subphrases a and a’ in compassos 5–6. Measures 7–8 lead to a half cadência.
