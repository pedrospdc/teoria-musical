##  Seção 19.1 Mode Mixture

Mode mixture typically consists of borrowing acordes from the parallel minor during a passage in a major key. “Borrowed acordes” refers to borrowing acordes from minor and is synonymous with mode mixture. In the examples that follow, notice the lowered chromaticisms—♭\\(\hat{6} \\) is most common but ♭\\(\hat{3} \\) and ♭\\(\hat{7} \\) also occur in borrowed acordes.

Notice the emotional effect of switching to the minor mode. 

A famous example that progresses from the major \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) acorde immediately to the minor \\(\left.\text{i}\right.\\) acorde is Richard Strauss’s Also Sprach Zarathustra.

Later during the opening of Also Sprach Zarathustra, another borrowed acorde occurs.

The next three examples have the padrão \\(\hat{1} \\)–♭\\(\hat{7} \\)–\\(\hat{6} \\)–♭\\(\hat{6} \\) in the bass line.

Figura 19.1.5. Hoyt Axton, “Joy to the World” (1970)

This same bass line can be found (in the same harmonic ritmo) in “Part of Your World.” 

Figura 19.1.6. Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, The Little Mermaid, “Part of Your World” (1989)

In the next example by Radiohead, the \\(\left.\text{iv}\right.\\) acorde (borrowed from minor) is preceded by the major \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) acorde.

Mode mixture is also found in the music of the band Nirvana.

Figura 19.1.8. Kurt Cobain, “Lithium” (1992)

In the example above for “Lithium,” the Roman numerals are analyzed as tríades instead of “5” acordes because the third of the acorde is either implied or occurs in the voice part (not shown). 

In the next example from the third movement Brahms’s Third Symphony, the \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) acorde alternates twice with a borrowed acorde. There are three flats in the armadura de clave because this movement began in C minor, but this section occurs later in the movement and is in C major.

Figura 19.1.9. Johannes Brahms, Symphony No. 3 in F major, Op. 90, III. Poco Allegretto (1883)

A similar alternation between the \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) acorde and a borrowed acorde (♭\\(\left.\text{VII}^{7}\right.\\)) happens in “Inchworm,” from the movie Hans Christian Andersen. Notice the special quality of the borrowed ♭\\(\hat{6} \\) in the superior melody.

A famous example of mode mixture occurs in the “Waltz of the Flowers” from Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker.

A similar melody occurs in “One Day I’ll Fly Away,” which, though it has a different harmonization, still uses mode mixture.
