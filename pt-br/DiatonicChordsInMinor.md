##  Seção 7.3 Diatonic Acordes in Minor

Because there are three versions of the escala menor, there are more than seven diatonic acordes in minor. The sixth and seventh escala degrees affect all of the tríades except the tônica, making 13 possible diatonic tríades in minor.

Notice that both \\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) (the “subtonic tríade”) and \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\) (the “leading-tone tríade”) are included. 

###  Definition 7.3.2.

The subtonic tríade (\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\)) is built on the lowered \\(\hat{7} \\) that occurs in _natural_ minor and requires no acidentes in minor keys. 

The subtonic tríade regularly occurs in circle of fifth progressions in minor (see [Seção 9.1](CircleOfFifths.html "Seção 9.1: The Circle of Fifths Progressão")) and in rock and pop music (see [Seção 9.6](SubtonicVIIinPopMusic.html "Seção 9.6: The Subtonic VII Acorde in Popular Music")). The leading-tone tríade (\\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\)) is built on raised \\(\hat{7} \\) and is usually either a passing harmony or has dominante function (see [Seção 9.4](HarmonicFunction.html "Seção 9.4: Harmonic Function")).
