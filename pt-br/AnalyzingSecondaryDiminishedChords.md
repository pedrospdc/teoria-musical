##  Seção 18.3 Analyzing Secondary Diminished Acordes

When you encounter a acorde with a chromaticism and suspect it is a secondary diminished seventh acorde, use the following process. 

  1. Stack the acorde in thirds to determine the root and quality. If the acorde quality is a diminished tríade or a half–diminished or fully–diminished seventh acorde, go on to step 2. If the acorde quality is not a diminished tríade or a half–diminished or fully–diminished seventh acorde, the acorde is not a secondary diminished acorde.

The acorde in question is an G♯ half–diminished seventh acorde in first inversion. 

  2. Determine the nota that would be a _minor 2nd above_ the root of the acorde you are analyzing. If this nota of resolution would be the root of a diatonic acorde, the acorde you are analyzing is a secondary diminished acorde.

This \\(\left.\text{G}^♯{}^ø{}^{7}\middle/\text{B}\right.\\) is analyzed as \\(\left.\text{vii}^ø{}^{6}_{5}\middle/\text{V}\right.\\) in D major.
