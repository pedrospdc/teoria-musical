##  Seção 33.2 Normal Form

Normal form represents the notas of a altura-class set (as they occur in the music) in their most compact form. 

To determine normal form, follow these steps: 

  1. Put the notas of a altura-class set from a piece of music in ascending numeric order (like a escala). Eliminate any duplicate pitches.

  2. Examine every possible ascending “escala” ordering of the notas until you find the most compact form—that is, the one that spans the smallest intervalo from lowest to highest nota.

  3. In the event that two orderings have the same intervalo span from lowest to highest nota, choose the set that has the smaller intervalo between the first and penultimate notas. 1 

The Forte method for determining prime form would have measured from first to second nota to break the tie instead of first to penultimate nota, which is the method used in Rahn’s Basic Atonal Theory.

  4. In the event of an absolute tie, choose the set that begins on the smaller number. We will use a different set of pitches to demonstrate a complete tie. The normal form for the notas below is [2, 3, 8, 9].

  5. Normal form is written in square brackets with commas. The normal form found in step 3 above was [11, 2, 3, 7].
