##  Seção 10.1 Introduction to Non-Acorde Tones

Non-acorde tones are notas that do not belong to the acorde. Sometimes referred to as “embellishing tones” and “non-harmonic tones,” non-acorde tones are classified by how they are approached and left (either by same tone, step, or leap). 

There are nine types of non-acorde tones.
