##  Seção 16.2 Figured Bass Inversion Symbols

Following are the figured bass inversion symbols most commonly used for tríades and seventh acordes. (Remember that figured bass numbers represent intervalos above the bass nota within the armadura de clave.)

Figura 16.2.2. Figured Bass Inversion Symbols for Seventh Acordes

Unlike original figured bass notation in the Baroque era, in music theory courses, figured bass inversion symbols are placed after Roman numerals. 

Compare figured bass symbols to the modified slash notation we have been using in previous chapters.

Because the figures \\(\left.\text{}^{6}_{5}\right.\\), \\(\left.\text{}^{4}_{3}\right.\\), and \\(\left.\text{}^{4}_{2}\right.\\) are only used for seventh acordes, the “7” is omitted when labeling inverted seventh acordes.

Figura 16.2.4. “7” is not included when 7th acordes are inverted

Notice that it is essential with seventh acordes to include symbols like “M” (for a major seventh acorde) and \\(\left.\text{}^{\circ}{}\right.\\) and \\(\left.\text{}^ø{}\right.\\) _before_ the figured bass numbers and _after_ the Roman numeral.
