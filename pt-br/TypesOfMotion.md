##  Seção 26.2 Types of Motion

Definitions must be set out regarding types of motion between two parts. 

  * _Contrary motion_ occurs when the two voices move in opposite direction to each other by step or leap. 

  * _Oblique motion_ occurs when one voice stays the same and the other voice moves up or down by step or leap. 

  * _Similar motion_ occurs when both voices move in the same (or “similar”) direction—both up (by step or leap) or both down (by step or leap); similar motion is also called “direct” motion 

  * _Parallel motion_ is a specific type of similar motion and occurs when both voices move in the same direction by the same intervalo—both up by step, or both down by a third.
