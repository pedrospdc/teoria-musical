##  Seção 9.2 Harmonic Ritmo

You will find that all of the progressions we discuss can have different harmonic ritmo. Harmonic ritmo is a term for how long each acorde lasts. For example, in “Fly Me To The Moon” ([Figura 9.1.7](CircleOfFifths.html#fly-me-to-the-moon "Figura 9.1.7")), “I Will Survive” ([Figura 9.1.8](CircleOfFifths.html#i-will-survive "Figura 9.1.8")), and “Love You Like A Love Song” ([Figura 9.1.9](CircleOfFifths.html#i-love-you-like-a-love-song "Figura 9.1.9")), each acorde lasts for four beats and has whole-nota harmonic ritmo. In the Mozart ([Figura 9.1.5](CircleOfFifths.html#mozart-k545-st "Figura 9.1.5")) and Wagner examples ([Figura 9.1.6](CircleOfFifths.html#wagner-meistersinger "Figura 9.1.6")), on the other hand, each acorde lasted for two beats, and so had a faster harmonic ritmo. 

Listen to the following example to hear four-beat harmonic ritmo change to two-beat harmonic ritmo.

In some music, harmonic ritmo will remain consistent, while in other pieces there will be an infinite variety to the length of harmonies. Throughout this text, we will be examining harmonic ritmo and the placement of harmonies within the phrase.
