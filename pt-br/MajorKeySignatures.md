##  Seção 2.3 Major Key Signatures

A armadura de clave is placed at the beginning of a piece (or the beginning of a section) and is written with the clave on the beginning of each line of music. The armadura de clave reminds the performer which sharps or flats are in the escala (or key) of the piece and prevents the composer or arranger from writing every sustenido or bemol from the escala every time it occurs.

There are 15 major armaduras de clave. The key of C major has no sharps or flats in the armadura de clave. The other armaduras de clave can have between 1 to 7 sharps and 1 to 7 flats, giving us the other 14 armaduras de clave.

It is important to memorize the order of sharps and flats, since you will be writing armaduras de clave regularly. 

The order of sharps is \\(\text{F}\\)–\\(\text{C}\\)–\\(\text{G}\\)–\\(\text{D}\\)–\\(\text{A}\\)–\\(\text{E}\\)–\\(\text{B}\\), often remembered by a mnemonic. One common mnemonic for the order of sharps is “Fast Cars Go Dangerously Around Every Bend.” 

The order of flats is \\(\text{B}\\)–\\(\text{E}\\)–\\(\text{A}\\)–\\(\text{D}\\)–\\(\text{G}\\)–\\(\text{C}\\)–\\(\text{F}\\). It is the reverse of the order of sharps. It is easy to remember since the first four letters make the word BEAD, and GCF is something most students learn as “Greatest Common Factor” when studying math in elementary school. 

A mnemonic that works forward and backward is “Father Charles Goes Down And Ends Battle,” which reversed is “Battle Ends And Down Goes Charles’ Father.” 

A helpful learning device to remember the order of keys in relation to the order of sharps and flats is the circle of fifths. As you ascend in fifths (clockwise), armaduras de clave get one degree “sharper.” (\\(\text{C}\\) to \\(\text{G}\\) is a fifth because \\(\text{C}\\)=1, \\(\text{D}\\)=2, \\(\text{E}\\)=3, \\(\text{F}\\)=4, and \\(\text{G}\\)=5.) As you descend in fifths (counterclockwise), armaduras de clave get one degree “flatter.”

Nota the overlapping keys at the bottom of the circle. \\(\text{B}\\) major is enharmonically the same as \\(\text{C}^♭\\) major, \\(\text{F}^♯\\) major is enharmonically the same as \\(\text{G}^♭\\) major, and \\(\text{C}^♯\\) major is enharmonically the same as \\(\text{D}^♭\\) major. 

###  Subsection 2.3.1 Identifying Key Signatures

While it is preferable to memorize armaduras de clave, use the following method to determine major armaduras de clave based on the sharps or flats in the armadura de clave. 

  1. _For armaduras de clave withs sharps_ : Go up a semitom from the last sustenido to find the key. 

  2. _For armaduras de clave with flats_ : The second-to-last bemol is the key.
