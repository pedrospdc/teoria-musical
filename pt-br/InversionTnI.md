##  Seção 33.8 Inversion (T\\(\text{}_{n}\\)I)

Inverting a set using T\\(\text{}_{n}\\)I is a compound operation. The first step is to invert each nota below C using C as an axis. For example, E is a major 3rd above C, so E would invert to A♭, a major third _below_ C.

The second step of inversion is to apply the T\\(\text{}_{n}\\) intervalo. So, to calculate T\\(\text{}_{3}\\)I for the nota E, one would first invert E to A♭ (this is T\\(\text{}_{0}\\)I), _then_ transpose the A♭ up 3 semitones to B. (Theorist Joseph Straus simplifies the nomenclature to I\\(\text{}_{n}\\) instead of T\\(\text{}_{n}\\)I, but the outcome remains the same.) 

Let’s try inverting a altura-class set, applying T\\(\text{}_{7}\\)I to [2, 4, 5] (or D, E, and F). Inverting the notas to the opposite side of C using C as an axis yields altura numbers 10, 8, and 7 (or B♭, A♭, and G), which in ascending order is 7, 8, and 10. Then transposing [7, 8, 10] at T\\(\text{}_{7}\\) raises each nota 7 semitones, resulting in [2, 3, 5] (or D, E♭, and F).

###  Subsection 33.8.1 Identifying T\\(\text{}_{n}\\)I for Inversionally-Related Sets

To determine _n_ of T\\(\text{}_{n}\\)I for two inversionally-related sets, write the second set backward and add the notas of the two sets together. Each sum will equal _n_. Let’s use our two sets from the previous example above: [2, 4, 5] and [2, 3, 5]. 

Tabela 33.8.1.

First set in order: |  | 2 | 4 | 5  
---|---|---|---|---  
Second set backward: | + | 5 | 3 | 2  
_n_ of T\\(\text{}_{n}\\)I: |  | 7 | 7 | 7  
  
This confirms the sets are related at T\\(\text{}_{7}\\)I.
