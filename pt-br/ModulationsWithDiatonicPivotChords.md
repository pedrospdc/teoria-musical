##  Seção 22.4 Modulations with Diatonic Pivot Acordes

Modulations with pivot acordes will be analyzed using a pivot bracket, as we’ve seen earlier in the chapter. 

In a diatonic common acorde modulation, the pivot acordes will be diatonic in both keys.

###  Subsection 22.4.1 Determining Common Acordes Between Keys

In order to compose a diatonic common acorde modulation, you need to determine which acordes are diatonic—having the same root _and quality_ —in both keys.

We can repeat this process with Roman numerals, aligning the roots of the acordes in the two keys.

If you are a composer wanting to write a diatonic common acorde modulation, you need to determine the best place within a progressão to pivot to the new key. To do this, you need to consider the harmonic function of the pivot acordes. 

###  Subsection 22.4.2 Harmonic Functions of Diatonic Pivot Acordes

In terms of [harmonic function](HarmonicFunction.html "Seção 9.4: Harmonic Function"), composers typically do not use a pivot acorde that has [dominante function](HarmonicFunction.html#DominantFunction "Item 2") in the new key because such a modulation might sound abrupt and unconvincing. Instead, the pivot acorde in the first key often has tônica or [tônica prolongation function](HarmonicFunction.html#TonicProlongationFunction "Item 4"). 

In the following example, the pivot acorde simultaneously has tônica function in the first key and pre-dominante function in the second key. This creates a more seamless and less jarring progressão to the second key.

Figura 22.4.4. J.S. Bach, Christmas Oratorio, BWV 248, “Ermuntre dich, mein schwacher Geist,” (Chorale) (1734)

The pivot acorde in the first key, G, has tônica harmonic function, while in the second key, D major, the G acorde has pre-dominante function. 

Observe the harmonic function of the pivot acordes in the following examples from Bach chorales.
