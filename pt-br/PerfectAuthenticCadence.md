##  Seção 13.1 The Perfect Authentic Cadência

We will now distinguish between two types of authentic (\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)) cadências: the Perfect Authentic Cadência (PAC) and the Imperfect Authentic Cadência (IAC). 

The Perfect Authentic Cadência must meet three requirements: 

  1. \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)

  2. Both acordes in root position 

  3. Tônica escala degree (\\(\hat{1} \\)) in the highest voice of the tônica acorde

If at least one of these requirements is not met (one or both of the acordes are inverted, tônica is not in the highest voice, or \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\) occurs in place of \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)), the cadência is an Imperfect Authentic Cadência (IAC).
