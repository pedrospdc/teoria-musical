##  Seção 11.4 Phrase

Musical form is full of sections, and the phrase is the smallest category of section. Unlike a motive, a phrase gives the sense of completing a formal unit. 

In classical music, phrases always end with [cadências](cadências.html "Seção 7.4: Cadences"); if you have encountered a cadência, you have just witnessed the completion of a phrase. In popular music, a phrase might be completed by a melody reaching four compassos in length or by completing a line of lyric instead of by a cadência. 

To generalize (or perhaps over-generalize), most of the phrases you encounter will be four compassos in length and will end with one of [the four cadência types](cadências.html "Seção 7.4: Cadences") (authentic cadência, half cadência, deceptive cadência, and, less commonly, the plagal cadência). While four- and eight-compasso phrases are the most common, you will also encounter phrases that are five, six, and seven compassos in length. Less commonly, you will encounter three-compasso phrases. 

Here are examples of four-compasso phrases. Notice that these phrases have a sense of completion even though they do not end with cadências.

Here is an example of a five-compasso phrase. Notice that the final acorde (a minor iv acorde, which will be discussed in the chapter on mode mixture) is part of a half cadência or deceptive cadência, yet the phrase has a feeling of completion, especially considering its relation to the phrases before and after it.

Examples of seven-compasso phrases are rare and often involve [elisions](Elision.html "Seção 13.7: The Elision"), which will be covered in a later [chapter](PhrasesInCombination.html "Capítulo 13: Phrases in Combination") when we discuss how phrases are combined to create small forms like [periods](PeriodForm.html "Seção 13.3: The Period") and [phrase groups](PhraseGroupsAndPhraseChains.html "Seção 13.6: Phrase Groups and Phrase Chains").
