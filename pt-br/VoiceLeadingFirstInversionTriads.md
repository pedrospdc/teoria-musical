##  Seção 26.8 Condução de Vozes First-Inversion Tríades

Instead of focusing on the intervallic distância the bass part travels between roots of acordes, condução de vozes first inversion tríades requires focusing on the doubling or voicing of the acorde itself. When approaching or leaving a first inversion acorde, move as smoothly as possible while avoiding objectionable parallels, spacing errors, and melodic errors. 

###  Subsection 26.8.1 Voicing a First Inversion Acorde

In contrast to the doubling rule for root position acordes (i.e., “double the bass”), do _not_ double the bass nota for first inversion tríades. Instead, double the root or fifth, depending on which can be approached and left most smoothly.

If the 3rd of a first inversion _is_ doubled, it will be in one of the following situations: 

  1. Diminished tríades in first inversion—always double the third (the bass), not the root or fifth

  2. Consecutive first inversion acordes—alternate between doubling the third and not doubling the third

  3. Approached in opposite direction in both parts

Nota that you should never double the third of the V acorde because it is the leading tone (\\(\hat{7} \\)).
