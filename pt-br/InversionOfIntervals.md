##  Seção 5.4 Inversion of Intervalos Explained

There are only two notas in an intervalo, one inferior and one higher. To invert an intervalo, change the position of the notas so the nota that was inferior is now higher.

In the above example, a m6 inverts to a M3. This is true for all notas a M3 (or m6) away from each other. Below are examples of how intervalos invert.

Nota that the symbol \\(\left.\text{}^{\circ}{}\right.\\) represents “diminished” (one semitom smaller than perfect or minor) and the symbol \\(\left.\text{}{+}\right.\\) represents “augmented” (one semitom larger than perfect or major). 

Below is a chart of how intervalos invert.

To write a small intervalo _below_ a given nota, you should be able to combine whole steps and half steps up to the intervalo of a perfect fourth (two whole steps plus one semitom). To write a larger intervalo below a given nota, invert the intervalo size, determine the nota _above_ , then write it _below_ the given nota.
