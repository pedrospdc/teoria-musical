##  Seção 31.11 Harmonizing the Bebop Escala

In The Jazz Theory Book, author Mark Levine provides a method for harmonizing the bebop escala maior (\\(\hat{1} \\)–\\(\hat{2} \\)–\\(\hat{3} \\)–\\(\hat{4} \\)–\\(\hat{5} \\)–\\(\hat{♯5} \\)–\\(\hat{6} \\)–\\(\hat{7} \\)–\\(\hat{8} \\)) with four voices. 

Try singing through each part—soprano, alto, tenor, then bass.

Notice that all of the non-tônica acordes are \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\\) acordes in various inversions. 

One hears a similar approach to harmonizing a escala (though without the fully-diminished seventh acordes as passing acordes) in the following example.
