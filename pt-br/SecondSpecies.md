##  Seção 30.3 Second Species Contraponto

In second species, one writes two half notas against a _cantus firmus_ in whole notas. (Second species can also include writing three half notas against a _cantus firmus_ of dotted whole notas in \\(\begin{smallmatrix}3\\\2\end{smallmatrix}\\).) The rules are generally the same as first species except that one simple dissonance is allowed in second species: the passing tone. Please see the details below. 

  1. Begin your contraponto with a half nota at the oitava or unison on either the first or third beat of the compasso; if starting on the third beat, put a half rest at the beginning of the compasso.

  2. End with a whole nota on an oitava or unison, using one of these concluding formulas:

     1. If the _cantus firmus_ is in the inferior part, approach the final oitava with intervalos of a fifth and sixth (\\(\hat{6} \\)–\\(\hat{7} \\) against \\(\hat{2} \\) in the _cantus firmus_). 

     2. If the _cantus firmus_ is in the superior part, approach the final oitava or unison with the intervalos of a fifth and third (\\(\hat{5} \\)–\\(\hat{7} \\) against \\(\hat{2} \\) in the _cantus firmus_). 

     3. Phrygian mode has an exception: if the cantus firmus is in the superior part, approach the final oitava or unison with the intervalos of a sixth to a third (\\(\hat{4} \\)–♭\\(\hat{7} \\) against ♭\\(\hat{2} \\) in the _cantus firmus_).

  3. Of the two half notas you write in each compasso, the first must always be a consonance (unison, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 8ve, or compound intervalo equivalent). If the second is a dissonance, it can only be a passing tone (approached and left by step). Otherwise, the second nota must be a consonance. The only allowable leaps are the same as in first species. 

  4. When crossing barlines, apply the following:

     1. “Imperfect” consonances (3rds and 6ths) can be approached in any manner. 

     2. “Perfect” consonances (unisons, 5ths, 8ves, 12ths) may only be approached in contrary motion in order to avoid direct 5ths and direct 8ves. 

     3. Do not repeat notas across barlines 

  5. Avoid 8ves on consecutive downbeats and avoid 5ths on consecutive downbeats _unless_ there is the leap of 4th occurring after the 8ve or 5th on the downbeat

Notice that dissonant intervalo numbers (2, 4, tt, 7) are circled to highlight that they must be handled in a special manner.
