##  Seção 23.3 The Fully Diminished Seventh as Pivot Acorde

Each diminished seventh sonority implies _four_ different keys. Play and sing through the example below.

Figura 23.3.1. The Four Resolutions of a Diminished Seventh Sonority

In the example above, each nota of the \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\\) acorde was treated in turn as escala degree \\(\hat{7} \\) and resolved up by semitom. In the example below, each nota of the acorde resolves as if it were the 7th of the acorde, moving down by semitom to the root of a dominante seventh acorde.

This means that for any diminished seventh acorde, you should be able to imagine the other three respellings in the same way you can imagine other spellings of words like _two_ (i.e., _to_ and _too_) or _there_ (_their_ and _they’re_). 

In the following examples, a \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\\) acorde is enharmonically reinterpreted in a new key. 

In the first example, Beethoven enharmonically reinterprets \\(\left.\text{F}^♯{}^{\circ}{}^{7}\middle/\text{C}\right.\\) in G minor (\\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{4}_{3}\right.\\)) as \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{4}_{2}\right.\\) in E minor (\\(\left.\text{D}^♯{}^{\circ}{}^{7}\middle/\text{C}\right.\\)), which resolves to a \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\) acorde in E minor.

In the next example from the second movement of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, Beethoven modulates from C major to A♭ major by enharmonically reinterpreting an \\(\left.\text{E}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\\) acorde in C (\\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{7}\middle/\text{IV}\right.\\)) as \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{4}_{2}\right.\\) in A♭ (\\(\left.\text{G}^{\circ}{}^{7}\middle/\text{F}^{♭}\right.\\)). Notice the unusual resolution of the \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{4}_{2}\right.\\) acorde to a \\(\left.\text{Ger}^{+6}\right.\\) acorde by leading all three of the superior voices of the \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{4}_{2}\right.\\) up by semitom to the \\(\left.\text{Ger}^{+6}\right.\\), which itself is unusually spelled in the key of A♭ major (E–A♭–C♭–D instead of F♭–A♭–C♭–D).

In the final example of this section, Schubert reinterprets a \\(\left.\text{G}^♯{}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\\) in G minor as an \\(\left.\text{E}^♯{}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\\) acorde in B minor (\\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{6}_{5}\middle/\text{V}\right.\\)). The \\(\left.\text{G}^♯{}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\\) acorde in G minor is analyzed as \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{4}_{2}\middle/\text{iv}\right.\\), meaning it could resolve to a C minor acorde, but it could also have been interpreted as \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{4}_{3}\middle/\text{VI}\right.\\), or as tonicizing an E♭ major acorde. Because the acorde never resolves in G minor, one cannot be certain of the intended resolution. Remember that diminished tríades are not tonicized, so the \\(\left.\text{G}^♯{}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\\) would not be considered as tonicizing the nota A (the root of the \\(\left.\text{ii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\) acorde) or F♯ (the root of the \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\) acorde).
