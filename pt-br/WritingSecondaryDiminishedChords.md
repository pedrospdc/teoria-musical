##  Seção 18.4 Writing Secondary Diminished Acordes

To write a secondary diminished acorde, use the following procedure. 

  1. First determine the nota that is the root of the acorde being tonicized (the acorde to the right of the slash).

  2. Determine \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\\) in the key of C minor (C is the root of the \\(\left.\text{iv}\right.\\) acorde, which is the Roman numeral _after_ the slash): _B_ is the root of \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\\) in C minor because it is a _m2 below_ C. 

  3. Build a fully–diminished seventh acorde on B: _B–D–F–A_ ♭ 

  4. Invert the acorde accordingly. \\(\left.\text{}^{4}_{2}\right.\\) inversion means the 7th of the acorde (A♭) is the bass nota.
