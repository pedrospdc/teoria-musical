##  Seção 23.1 Enharmonic Modulation

In an enharmonic modulation, the pivot acorde is almost always misspelled in one of the keys and therefore must be reconceptualized enharmonically by the analyst. In this regard, an enharmonic modulation is a harmonic pun. 

Here is a pun from Shakespeare’s Richard III, Act 1, Scene 1: 

Now is the winter of our discontent

Made glorious summer by this sun of York

The “sun” of York is the _son_ of York, King Edward IV. 

Here is a simple enharmonic modulation:

Figura 23.1.1. Enharmonic Modulation from C major to B minor

Like a verbal pun, this harmonic pun is effective because the third acorde (\\(\left.\text{G}^{7}\right.\\)) has two “meanings”—in the context of C major, \\(\left.\text{G}^{7}\right.\\) is \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\) and the root wants to cadência down a fifth to C, but the \\(\left.\text{G}^{7}\right.\\) is a [\\(\left.\text{Ger}^{+6}\right.\\)](TypesOfAugmentedSixthChords.html "Seção 21.2: Types of Augmented Sixth Acordes") in the context of B minor, where the root of the \\(\left.\text{G}^{7}\right.\\) wants to progress down a semitom to a acorde of dominante function, \\(\left.\text{i}^{6}_{4}\right.\\) in the example above.

Figura 23.1.2.

Notice that the \\(\left.\text{G}^{7}\right.\\) can only be spelled correctly in one of the keys—either as a dominante seventh acorde on G (G–B–D–F) or as a \\(\left.\text{Ger}^{+6}\right.\\) on G (G–B–D–E♯), hence the term “enharmonic modulation.” The analyst must envision the other spelling (the one not shown) to understand the double context, in the same way “sun of York” must be envisioned as “son of York.” 

We will encounter two sonorities used in enharmonic modulations: the dominante seventh sonority and the diminished seventh sonority.
