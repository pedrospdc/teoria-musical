##  Seção 32.2 Pandiatonicism

Pandiatonicism refers to the use of all diatonic notas without the need for escala degrees or harmonies to progress or function tonally (V doesn’t need to progress to I, \\(\hat{7} \\) doesn’t need to resolve to \\(\hat{8} \\), etc.). One often hears it as a wash of notas from the escala maior, or as acordes made of non-traditional combinations of notas from a escala maior, often with at least one intervalo of a 2nd in a acorde voicing. 

In the first example, notice how Stravinsky creates a wash of sound from the notas of the escala maior.

In the second example, Copland uses non-traditional pandiatonic acorde shapes in non-functional harmonic progressão.

The third example is similar to the first, with Copland creating a wash of sound from the notas of the escala maior, with no regard to the dissonant intervalos occurring in contraponto.
