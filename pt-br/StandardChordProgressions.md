##  Seção 31.8 Standard Acorde Progressions

In this section we will focus only on the ii–V–I progressão and the iii–vi–ii–V progressão. Both were already mentioned in [Seção 9.3](ShorterProgressionsFromTheCircleOfFifths.html "Seção 9.3: Shorter Progressions from the Circle of Fifths"). 

###  Subsection 31.8.1 II–V–I

The II–V–I is one of most common progressions in jazz, especially in tunes like “Autumn Leaves,” “What Is This Thing Called Love,” “Tune-Up,” “Pent Up House,” “Lady Bird,” and “Firm Roots,” to name just a few. In major the progressão is Dmin9–G9(13)–C\\(\left.\text{}{\Delta}\right.\\)9\. In minor it is Dmin7(♭5)–G7alt–Cm\\(\begin{smallmatrix}6\\\9\end{smallmatrix}\\).

###  Subsection 31.8.2 III–VI–II–V

The iii–vi–ii–V progressão is called a turnaround because it replaces the static harmony of the I acorde in the last two compassos of a tune with harmonic motion that leads to the I acorde that will occur upon repetition to the top of the form. This also applies to the I–VI–II–V progressão. 

One can modify a iii–vi–ii–V turnaround so all four acordes are dominante seventh acordes: III\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\)–VI\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\)–II\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\)–V\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\) (or V\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\)/vi–V\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\)/ii–V\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\)/V–V\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\)—E\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\)–A\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\)–D\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\)–G\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\) in lead sheet symbols). Turnarounds made solely of dominante seventh acordes can them employ tritone substitutions (substituting a dominante seventh acorde a tritone away because they have the same guide tones). For example, E\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\)–A\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\)–D\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\)–G\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\) becomes E\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\)– _E_ ♭\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\)–D\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\)– _D_ ♭\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\).

Because of tritone substitutions, the ♭II\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\) acorde can be substituted for V\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\). In C, D♭9(13) is often substituted for \\(\left.\text{G}^{7}\left(\begin{smallmatrix}\text{♯9}\\\\\text{♯5}\end{smallmatrix}\right)\right.\\).

###  Subsection 31.8.3 The Blues Progressão

Below are two choruses of a common jazz version of the [blues progressão](TwelveBarBlues.html "Seção 12.4: The 12-Bar Blues"). The first chorus uses the first category of voicings (“spread” voicings) while the second chorus uses the second category (“close” voicings with the 3rd or 7th as the lowest nota). 

Notice that the voicings for the \\(\left.\text{A}^{7}\left(\begin{smallmatrix}\text{♯9}\\\\\text{♯5}\end{smallmatrix}\right)\right.\\) and \\(\left.\text{E}^♭{}^{9}\left(\text{13}\right)\right.\\) are identical (not counting the roots) because the \\(\left.\text{E}^♭{}^{9}\left(\text{13}\right)\right.\\) is a tritone substitution for the \\(\left.\text{A}^{7}\left(\begin{smallmatrix}\text{♯9}\\\\\text{♯5}\end{smallmatrix}\right)\right.\\). The same is true for the \\(\left.\text{G}^{7}\left(\begin{smallmatrix}\text{♯9}\\\\\text{♯5}\end{smallmatrix}\right)\right.\\) and the \\(\left.\text{D}^♭{}^{9}\left(\text{13}\right)\right.\\). The Roman numerals below the staves are simplified.

Notice that the condução de vozes is very smooth for each part with the exception of the bass line. All voices move by step or by 3rd.
