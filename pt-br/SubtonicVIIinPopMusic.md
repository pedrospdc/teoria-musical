##  Seção 9.6 The Subtonic VII Acorde in Popular Music

Although we will discuss mode mixture and the Mixolydian mode later, the ubiquity of the subtonic acorde (♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\)) in rock and popular music makes it important to discuss here. 

The ♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) acorde can precede tônica, dominante, and pre-dominante acordes, which means it can substitute for any function except tônica.

Notice also that movement from \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) (from the plagal cadência) is common in the following examples from popular music. 

Here are examples ending with ♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\), where \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) progresses to \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) (a plagal cadência) and is preceded by ♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\).

Consider the following questions: When a phrase ends on the \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) acorde, does it have dominante function (i.e, is it a half cadência)? Does \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) have dominante function in popular music when it progresses to \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)? If so, does ♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) have pre-dominante function in the above progressão? 

Notice that ♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) begins the phrase in the following example, and proceeds to a \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) conclusion.

The following example has ♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) preceding _and following_ the \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) acorde. Does the ♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) acorde have tônica prolongation as labeled, or is it “pre pre-dominante” in function?

Here is an example with ♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) cadencing to the \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) acorde in the first four compassos then progressing to the \\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\) acorde in a deceptive cadência in the second four compassos.
