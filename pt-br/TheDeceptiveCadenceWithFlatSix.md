##  Seção 19.4 The Deceptive Cadência with ♭\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\)

The \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–♭\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\) deceptive cadência is a deceptive realization of a deceptive progressão. This \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–♭\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\) cadência ties into the [♭\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\)–♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) progressão](i-VII-VI-VII.html "Seção 9.8: The i–VII–VI–VII Progressão") to produce an “epic” (although somewhat clichéd) ending to the “Star Spangled Banner” as performed at the Super Bowl and Presidential Inaugurations by artists such as Whitney Houston, Beyoncé, and Lady Gaga, among others.

This same \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–♭\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\) deceptive cadência with ♭\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\) progressing to ♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) followed by \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) occurs in epic fashion at the end of the animated film Beauty and the Beast from 1991.
