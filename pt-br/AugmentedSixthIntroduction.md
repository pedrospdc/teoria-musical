##  Seção 21.1 Augmented Sixth Acordes

Augmented sixth acordes are a special class of [pre-dominante](HarmonicFunction.html#PreDominantFunction "Item 3") acordes with notas that approach the dominante (\\(\hat{5} \\)) from a half-step below (♯\\(\hat{4} \\)) and from a half-step above (♭\\(\hat{6} \\)) simultaneously.

In minor, ♭\\(\hat{6} \\) doesn’t require a bemol because \\(\hat{6} \\) is lowered in the minor armadura de clave.
