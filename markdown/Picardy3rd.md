##  Section 19.5 The Picardy 3rd

It is rare to borrow from the major mode during a passage in a minor key. The major tonic usually functions as \\(\left.\text{V}\middle/\text{iv}\right.\\) if it’s not the last chord of a piece, and raised \\(\hat{6} \\) and \\(\hat{7} \\) occur naturally as part of the melodic minor scale. 

In minor, the one place to borrow from the major mode is at the end of a piece in minor, with the use of the major \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) chord instead of minor \\(\left.\text{i}\right.\\).

While the Picardy 3rd (the major third above the tonic) was most commonly encountered in the Baroque era, it has been used from then until now, though with less frequency.
