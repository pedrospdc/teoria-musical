##  Section 5.3 How to Write Perfect, Major, and Minor Intervals

To write an interval _above_ a given note, use the two methods given below. 

If you are asked to write a minor sixth above the note \\(\text{A}\\), start with the \\(\text{A}\\) major scale and key signature. In \\(\text{A}\\) major, there is an \\(\text{F}^♯\\), which is a major sixth above the note \\(\text{A}\\). Therefore, \\(\text{F}^♮\\) is a minor sixth above \\(\text{A}\\).

Alternatively, you can simply count the number of half steps. If you know there are 8 half steps in a minor sixth, you can count from \\(\text{A}\\) up to \\(\text{F}\\). 

Writing small intervals up to a major third _below_ a given note is straightforward using a combination of whole and half steps. However, to write larger intervals below a given note, it is sometimes helpful to invert the interval first ([Inversion of Intervals Explained](InversionOfIntervals.html "Section 5.4: Inversion of Intervals Explained") is discussed in the next section).
