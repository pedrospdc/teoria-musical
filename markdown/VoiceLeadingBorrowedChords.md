##  Section 29.2 Voice Leading Borrowed Chords

[Borrowed chords](ModeMixtureSection.html "Section 19.1: Mode Mixture"), or chords making use of mode mixture, are handled similarly to their diatonic versions in terms of voice leading, e.g., \\(\left.\text{ii}^ø{}^{7}\right.\\) is handled similarly to \\(\left.\text{ii}^{7}\right.\\). In any of the borrowed chords with ♭\\(\hat{6} \\), resolve this tendency tone down by step whenever possible. 

###  Principle 29.2.1. Voice Leading Borrowed Chords.

Resolve ♭\\(\hat{6} \\) down by step when it is a chord member of a borrowed chord.

Another situation where you may encounter a borrowed chord is the \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–♭\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\) cadence, which should be handled the same as the deceptive cadence in minor (see [Principle 26.7.4](VoiceLeadingFourPartsRootPosition.html#voice-leading-deceptive-cadence "Principle 26.7.4: Voice leading the deceptive progression"))—resolve the 3rd of the \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) chord up by step and move the other two voices in contrary motion to the bass. 

There are no specific rules for other borrowed chords such as ♭\\(\left.\text{III}\right.\\), ♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\), \\(\left.\text{i}\right.\\), and \\(\left.\text{v}\right.\\); simply voice lead them as smoothly as possible while avoiding objectionable parallels.
