##  Section 13.6 Phrase Groups and Phrase Chains

Phrase groups and phrase chains are not periods. In phrase groups and phrase chains, _the final cadence is a half cadence_. A phrase group consists of at least two phrases whose melodies begin similarly and has the final phrase ending in a half cadence. The terminology in this section draws from Douglass Green’s Form in Tonal Music.

A phrase chain also ends in a half cadence and consists of at least two phrases with _contrasting_ melodies.
