##  Section 9.8 The i–VII–VI–VII Progression

The \\(\left.\text{i}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) (\\(\left.\text{A}\text{m}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{G}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{F}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{G}\right.\\)) progression is similar to the descending \\(\hat{1} \\) –♭\\(\hat{7} \\)–♭\\(\hat{6} \\)–\\(\hat{5} \\) bass line of the “Andalusian progression” (\\(\left.\text{A}\text{m}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{G}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{F}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{E}\right.\\)) in flamenco music, with the exception of the last bass note or chord. 

Here are examples of the \\(\left.\text{i}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) progression.

The \\(\left.\text{i}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) progression can also be rotated to become \\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{i}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\).

Figure 9.8.3. The \\(\left.\text{i}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) progression rotating to \\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{i}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\)

In some cases, the fourth chord is eliminated. In that case, \\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{i}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) becomes \\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{i}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{i}\right.\\), as in the following examples.

The \\(\left.\text{i}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) progression can also be thought of as being in a major key: \\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\).

There are several more common harmonic progressions to explore in future chapters dealing with topics like [secondary chords](ExamplesWithSecondaryDominants.html "Section 17.1: Examples with Secondary Dominants"), [mode mixture](ModeMixtureSection.html "Section 19.1: Mode Mixture"), [the Neapolitan chord](ExamplesOfTheNeapolitanChord.html "Section 20.2: Examples of the Neapolitan Chord"), [augmented sixth chords](ExamplesWithAugmentedSixthChords.html "Section 21.5: Examples with Augmented Sixth Chords"), and [jazz harmony](StandardChordProgressions.html "Section 31.8: Standard Chord Progressions").
