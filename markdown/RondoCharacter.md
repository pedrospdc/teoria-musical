##  Section 25.4 Rondo Character

Rondo character is characterized by quick tempo in duple meter with light character, typically achieved through the use of staccato articulation. This duple meter could be either simple (\\(\begin{smallmatrix}2\\\4\end{smallmatrix}\\)) or compound (\\(\begin{smallmatrix}6\\\8\end{smallmatrix}\\)). During the Classical era, the final movement of a multi-movement composition, e.g. a sonata, quartet, or symphony, was often in rondo character. Not all pieces in rondo form are in rondo character.
