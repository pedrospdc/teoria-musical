##  Section 12.1 Verse-Chorus Form

The Verse-Chorus form is arguably the most common musical form of present day popular music and is probably familiar to most readers of this text. In Verse-Chorus form, the chorus contains the “hook”—the memorable refrain—while the verse typically contains less memorable melodic material. A clear example can be found in the 1985 song “We Are the World.”

It is worth noting that there may disagreement about labeling sections in a form. One person may call a section a “pre-chorus,” another may call it a “first chorus,” while another may call it “verse part b.” There is ambiguity in naming sections and disagreement is to be expected. 

There are “simple” and “contrasting” verse-chorus forms. A simple verse-chorus form has the same harmonic progression for the verse and chorus (e.g., “[All About That Bass](https://youtu.be/7PCkvCPvDXk)”). The chord progressions for the verse and chorus are different in a contrasting verse-chorus form like “We Are the World.”
