Notice that \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}\middle/\text{III}\right.\\) in minor is not included because it is \\(\left.\text{ii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\). Notice also that \\(\left.\text{vii}^ø{}^{7}\middle/\text{III}\right.\\) has no accidentals—it is the same as \\(\left.\text{ii}^ø{}^{7}\right.\\) but functions differently. The \\(\left.\text{ii}^ø{}^{7}\right.\\) chord has [pre–dominant function](HarmonicFunction.html#PreDominantFunction "Item 3") and progresses to \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) whereas the \\(\left.\text{vii}^ø{}^{7}\middle/\text{III}\right.\\) chord progresses to \\(\left.\text{III}\right.\\). 

Minor triads are tonicized by fully diminished seventh chords. Major triads are traditionally tonicized by half diminished seventh chords but can also be tonicized by fully diminished seventh chords.
