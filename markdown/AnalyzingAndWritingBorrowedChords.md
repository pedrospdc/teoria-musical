##  Section 19.3 Analyzing and Writing Borrowed Chords

Unlike secondary chords, you merely note the root, quality, and inversion of a borrowed chord in your Roman numeral analysis. 

So, for the following chord:

Notice that the root is A when you stack the notes in 3rds, and A is \\(\hat{2} \\) in G major. The quality is half–diminished since the 3rds stack as m3–m3–M3, making this a \\(\left.\text{ii}^ø{}^{7}\right.\\) chord. Since C, the 3rd of the chord, is in the bass, the correct analysis is \\(\left.\text{ii}^ø{}^{6}_{5}\right.\\). 

To write a borrowed chord from a Roman numeral, be sure to _pay close attention to the quality of the Roman numeral_. 

A: ♭\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\)

♭\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\) is built on ♭\\(\hat{6} \\). Determine ♭\\(\hat{6} \\) in A major, which is F♮, then stack 3rds in the configuration M3–m3. The resulting triad contains F♮–A–C♮.

Be careful of flats before Roman numerals. Flats mean to lower a root a m2 _in the key signature_ , _not_ to literally put a flat in front of the root of a chord.
