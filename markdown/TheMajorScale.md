##  Section 2.2 The Major Scale

A major scale contains a specific succession of whole and half steps. It is helpful to think of the pattern as consisting of two tetrachords. (A tetrachord is a four-note scale segment.) The lower tetrachord consists of the pattern whole step, whole step, half step. A whole step joins the lower tetrachord to the upper tetrachord. The upper tetrachord duplicates the pattern in the lower one: whole step, whole step, half step. If we use W for whole step and H for half step, the major scale pattern is W–W–H, Whole–step connection, W–W–H.

All major scales use the notes of the musical alphabet in order; no notes are skipped and no notes occur twice. In the example above, the first four notes are \\(\text{D}\\)–\\(\text{E}\\)–\\(\text{F}^♯\\)–\\(\text{G}\\), not \\(\text{D}\\)–\\(\text{E}\\)–\\(\text{G}^♭\\)–\\(\text{G}\\). In \\(\text{D}\\)–\\(\text{E}\\)–\\(\text{G}^♭\\)–\\(\text{G}\\), \\(\text{G}\\) erroneously occurs twice and the \\(\text{F}^♯\\) between \\(\text{E}\\) and \\(\text{G}\\) is skipped.
