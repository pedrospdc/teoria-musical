##  Section 21.3 Analyzing Augmented Sixth Chords

Since our process for analyzing chords has been to stack them up in thirds to determine the root and quality, it is worth examing these four augmented sixth chords as stacks of thirds.

Figure 21.3.1. Augmented Sixth Chords Stacked in Thirds

Notice that all augmented sixth chords contain a \\(\left.\text{}^{\circ}{}\right.\\)3 when stacked in 3rds. None of the chords we have studied so far contain diminished thirds. 

###  Principle 21.3.2. Augmented Sixth Chords.

When you encounter a chord with a diminished third, it is an augmented sixth chord. 

Once you determine the chord you are analyzing has a \\(\left.\text{}^{\circ}{}\right.\\)3, _analyze the scale degrees_ to determine which type of augmented sixth chord it is.
