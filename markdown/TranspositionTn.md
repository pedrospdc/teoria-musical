##  Section 33.7 Transposition (T\\(\text{}_{n}\\))

Transposition is an operation performed as T\\(\text{}_{n}\\), where _n_ is the number of semitones _up_ a set is transposed. For example, [1, 2, 4, 6] at T\\(\text{}_{4}\\) is [5, 6, 8, 10].

When working in a modulo 12 system, remember that numbers larger than 12 have to be reduced to a number smaller than 12 by subtracting 12 from the larger number. For example, 6, 8, 10, 11 at T\\(\text{}_{9}\\) would result in 15, 17, 19, 20, which, after subtracting 12 from each number, results in 3, 5, 7, 8.

Pitch classes: |  | 6 | 8 | 10 | 11  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
at T\\(\text{}_{9}\\): | + | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9  
Result: |  | 15 | 17 | 19 | 20  
Make numbers modulo 12: | – | 12 | 12 | 12 | 12  
Result: |  | 3 | 5 | 7 | 8
