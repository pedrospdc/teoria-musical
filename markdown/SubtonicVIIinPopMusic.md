##  Section 9.6 The Subtonic VII Chord in Popular Music

Although we will discuss mode mixture and the Mixolydian mode later, the ubiquity of the subtonic chord (♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\)) in rock and popular music makes it important to discuss here. 

The ♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) chord can precede tonic, dominant, and pre-dominant chords, which means it can substitute for any function except tonic.

Notice also that movement from \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) (from the plagal cadence) is common in the following examples from popular music. 

Here are examples ending with ♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\), where \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) progresses to \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) (a plagal cadence) and is preceded by ♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\).

Consider the following questions: When a phrase ends on the \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) chord, does it have dominant function (i.e, is it a half cadence)? Does \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) have dominant function in popular music when it progresses to \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)? If so, does ♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) have pre-dominant function in the above progression? 

Notice that ♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) begins the phrase in the following example, and proceeds to a \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) conclusion.

The following example has ♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) preceding _and following_ the \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) chord. Does the ♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) chord have tonic prolongation as labeled, or is it “pre pre-dominant” in function?

Here is an example with ♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) cadencing to the \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) chord in the first four bars then progressing to the \\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\) chord in a deceptive cadence in the second four bars.
