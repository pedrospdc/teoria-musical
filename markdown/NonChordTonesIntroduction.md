##  Section 10.1 Introduction to Non-Chord Tones

Non-chord tones are notes that do not belong to the chord. Sometimes referred to as “embellishing tones” and “non-harmonic tones,” non-chord tones are classified by how they are approached and left (either by same tone, step, or leap). 

There are nine types of non-chord tones. 

Table 10.1.1.

_Non-Chord Tone_ | _Approached by_ | _Left by_  
---|---|---  
Passing Tone | step | step in same direction  
Neighbor Tone | step | step in opposite direction  
Appoggiatura | leap | step  
Escape Tone | step | leap in opposite direction  
Double Neighbor | see text | see text  
Anticipation | step | same note  
Pedal Point | same note | same note  
Suspension | same note | step down  
Retardation | same note | step up  
  
The following qualifiers can be applied to non-chord tones: 

  * Accented—occurring on the beat 

  * Unaccented—occurring on the weak part of the beat (on the offbeat) 

  * Chromatic—not belonging to the key 

  * Metrical—equal to the duration of the beat 

  * Sub-metrical—smaller than the beat 

  * Super-metrical—larger than the beat
