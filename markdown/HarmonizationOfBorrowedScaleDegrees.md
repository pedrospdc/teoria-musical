Let us examine the ways ♭\\(\hat{6} \\) can be harmonized as root, 3rd, 5th, and 7th of a borrowed chord.

Here are the ways ♭\\(\hat{3} \\) and ♭\\(\hat{7} \\) can each be harmonized as root, 3rd, and 5th of a borrowed chord (notice some of these chords are duplicates from the previous example).

It is not necessary to memorize the chords in this section so much as to realize that the quality of diatonic chords will be altered when a scale degree from the minor mode is included in the chord.
