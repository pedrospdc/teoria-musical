##  Section 27.4 The Special Resolution of vii\\(\left.\text{}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\\) (and vii\\(\left.\text{}^ø{}^{7}\right.\\))

The \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\\) and \\(\left.\text{vii}^ø{}^{7}\right.\\) chords consist entirely of tendency tones (\\(\hat{7} \\), \\(\hat{2} \\), \\(\hat{4} \\), \\(\hat{6} \\)). If one resolves all of those tendency tones correctly (\\(\hat{2} \\)–\\(\hat{1} \\), \\(\hat{4} \\)–\\(\hat{3} \\), \\(\hat{6} \\)–\\(\hat{5} \\), \\(\hat{7} \\)–\\(\hat{8} \\)), one might write parallel 5ths depending on the voicing of the \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\\) and \\(\left.\text{vii}^ø{}^{7}\right.\\) chord. Therefore, be sure to memorize the following principle: 

###  Principle 27.4.1. Resolving \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\\).

When the 7th of a \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\\) or \\(\left.\text{vii}^ø{}^{7}\right.\\) chord is voiced above the 3rd of the chord, resolve the 3rd of the chord (scale degree \\(\hat{2} \\)) up by step while resolving all other tendency tones normally (\\(\hat{4} \\)–\\(\hat{3} \\), \\(\hat{6} \\)–\\(\hat{5} \\), \\(\hat{7} \\)–\\(\hat{8} \\)).

Figure 27.4.2. Resolving \\(\left.\text{vii}^ø{}^{7}\right.\\)

The third measure above shows that revoicing the chord is another solution, since parallel 4ths are not objectionable in this situation. 

If the 7th of the chord is voiced _below_ the 3rd of the chord, resolve all tendency tones normally.
