##  Section 34.3 Writing Row Forms

To write specified row forms from a given prime form, write all four versions of the row: P, R, I, and RI. Then, simply transpose the specified row form to the correct pitch, remembering that P and I forms start on the pitch integer (P\\(\text{}_{3}\\) and I\\(\text{}_{3}\\) would begin on E♭, for example) while R and RI forms _end_ on the pitch integer (R\\(\text{}_{3}\\) and RI\\(\text{}_{3}\\) would end on E♭). 

To write I\\(\text{}_{9}\\) and RI\\(\text{}_{5}\\) if given P\\(\text{}_{0}\\): 

  1. Write all four row forms (P, R, I, RI).

  2. Transpose the specified row form to the correct transposition level. 

     1. In this example, transpose I\\(\text{}_{0}\\) up 9 semitones (a major 6th) to begin on A (pitch class 9).

     2. To write RI\\(\text{}_{5}\\), transpose RI\\(\text{}_{0}\\) up 5 semitones (a perfect 4th) so the last note is F (pitch class 5).
