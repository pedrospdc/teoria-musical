##  Section 8.2 The IV/5 “sus” chord

An additional four-note chord that sounds like and functions similar to a \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\) chord is the \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)/\\(\hat{5} \\) (or \\(\left.\text{F}\middle/\text{G}\right.\\) in \\(\text{C}\\) major) chord. In popular music this chord often is substituted for the \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\) chord
