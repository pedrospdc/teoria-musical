##  Section 24.7 Ternary Form

Ternary form is usually diagrammed as ABA and is described as “statement, digression, restatement.” 1

A piece in a rather simple and straightforward ternary is shown below.

Character pieces from the Romantic era with titles such as “Nocturne,” “Intermezzo,” and “Song Without Words,” among others, by composers such as Schubert, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Schumann, and Brahms, are often in a larger ternary form where each section might be longer than eight bars. 

Below are examples from a larger ternary piece, Rachmaninov’s Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op.3 No.2.

###  Subsection 24.7.1 Compound Ternary

A compound ternary is a ternary form in which one of the sections (the A or the B) is itself a binary or ternary form. Examples can be found in the minuet and trio as well as the da capo aria. 

In the next section, we will examine the differences between rounded binary and ternary.
