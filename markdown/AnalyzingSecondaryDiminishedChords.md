##  Section 18.3 Analyzing Secondary Diminished Chords

When you encounter a chord with a chromaticism and suspect it is a secondary diminished seventh chord, use the following process. 

  1. Stack the chord in thirds to determine the root and quality. If the chord quality is a diminished triad or a half–diminished or fully–diminished seventh chord, go on to step 2. If the chord quality is not a diminished triad or a half–diminished or fully–diminished seventh chord, the chord is not a secondary diminished chord.

The chord in question is an G♯ half–diminished seventh chord in first inversion. 

  2. Determine the note that would be a _minor 2nd above_ the root of the chord you are analyzing. If this note of resolution would be the root of a diatonic chord, the chord you are analyzing is a secondary diminished chord.

This \\(\left.\text{G}^♯{}^ø{}^{7}\middle/\text{B}\right.\\) is analyzed as \\(\left.\text{vii}^ø{}^{6}_{5}\middle/\text{V}\right.\\) in D major.
