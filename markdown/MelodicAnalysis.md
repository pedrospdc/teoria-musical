##  Chapter 11 Melodic Analysis

We will divide analysis of melodies into [motives](MotiveSection.html "Section 11.1: Motive") (which can be broken into [fragments](FragmentSection.html "Section 11.3: Fragment")) and [phrases](PhraseSection.html "Section 11.4: Phrase") (which can be broken into [subphrases](subphrase.html "Section 11.5: Subphrase")) in order to understand the construction of melodies. We will discuss periods and sentences in another chapter.
