##  Section 24.5 Simple Binary

“Simple” binary is a term used to describe a binary form that does not have features like the similar endings of a balanced binary or the return of opening material like the rounded binary. You will encounter this type of binary form in music especially throughout the Baroque era, as well as in the early Classical era.

Notice in the example above that the first section and second section can begin similarly in a binary form, resulting in the large-scale form AA’. The second section often features development of the primary idea from the first section. We will discuss development in the next chapter.
