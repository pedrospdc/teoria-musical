##  Section 7.2 Diatonic Chords in Major

Observe the pattern of diatonic chords in major represented by Roman numerals. (Diatonic means notes _within_ a key signature and can be contrasted with the term “chromatic.”) One sees the pattern M-m-m-M-M-m-\\(\left.\text{}^{\circ}{}\right.\\) in triad quality.
