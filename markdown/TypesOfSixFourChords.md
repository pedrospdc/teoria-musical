##  Section 26.11 Types of Six-Four Chords

When you are harmonizing melodies and writing music, there are three situations where it is appropriate to use a \\(\left.\text{}^{6}_{4}\right.\\) chord. 

  1. Pedal \\(\left.\text{}^{6}_{4}\right.\\)

  2. Passing \\(\left.\text{}^{6}_{4}\right.\\)

  3. Cadential \\(\left.\text{}^{6}_{4}\right.\\)

The pedal \\(\left.\text{}^{6}_{4}\right.\\) typically occurs in the patterns I–IV\\(\left.\text{}^{6}_{4}\right.\\)–I or V–I\\(\left.\text{}^{6}_{4}\right.\\)–V.

The passing \\(\left.\text{}^{6}_{4}\right.\\) typically occurs in the patterns I–V\\(\left.\text{}^{6}_{4}\right.\\)–I\\(\left.\text{}^{6}\right.\\) (or its [retrograde](MelodicAlteration.html#RetrogradeSection "Subsection 11.2.7: Retrograde")) and IV–I\\(\left.\text{}^{6}_{4}\right.\\)–IV\\(\left.\text{}^{6}\right.\\) (or its retrograde).

In an earlier section we discussed the [Cadential \\(\left.\text{}^{6}_{4}\right.\\) chord](TheCadentialSixFourChord.html "Section 16.3: The Cadential Six-Four Chord"). Please refer to that section to review the cadential \\(\left.\text{}^{6}_{4}\right.\\) chord.
