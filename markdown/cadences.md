##  Section 7.4 Cadences

We’ve been studying harmony—triads and chords. A cadence is a harmonic arrival point, a harmonic moment of stasis. A cadence can be compared to a comma or period in written language—the ear gets a moment to process a short passage of music, then the music continues. We will differentiate between four basic cadences now, adding [more specificity in a later chapter](PerfectAuthenticCadence.html "Section 13.1: The Perfect Authentic Cadence").

  1. Authentic Cadence (AC): a phrase ending with the chords \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)

  2. Plagal Cadence (PC): a phrase ending with the chords \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)

  3. Deceptive Cadence (DC): a phrase ending with the chords \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)

  4. Half Cadence (HC): a phrase ending on the \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) chord

In the example above, the notes surrounded by parentheses are [non-chord tones](NonChordTones.html "Chapter 10: Non-Chord Tones"), which will be studied later. Also, there are [seventh chords](SeventhChords.html "Chapter 8: Seventh Chords") in this example, which we will study in the next chapter. 

Here is another example ending with an authentic cadence.

###  Subsection 7.4.2 Examples of Plagal Cadences

Here are examples with plagal cadences.

The following example, from the prelude to Act I of Richard Wagner’s opera Tristan und Isolde, is arguably one of the most famous deceptive cadences in the history of classical music.

A deceptive cadence means \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) did not go to \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\). This means that “\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) to not-\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)” is technically a more correct description for a deceptive cadence than \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)-\\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\), which is the most common realization of “\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) to not-\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\).” 

In the example below, \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) goes to \\(\left.\text{IV}\middle/\text{3rd}\right.\\).

You may encounter chords with no thirds in rock and pop music. If you encounter a chord that has only a root and fifth, label it with a “5” after the root in lead sheet labeling (e.g., \\(\left.\text{B}^{5}\right.\\), as in the next example). 

Additionally, you may encounter incomplete chords. 

####  Definition 7.4.12.

Incomplete chords are chords containing only the root and third but no fifth.
