##  Section 27.3 Voice Leading the \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\) to \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) Progression

In voice leading the \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\) to \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) progression in four parts, one must deliberately choose one of the following methods: 

  1. “Strict” resolution: 

     1. Complete \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\) to incomplete I: resolve \\(\hat{7} \\) up and \\(\hat{4} \\) and \\(\hat{2} \\) down. This means resolving the 3rd of the \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\) chord (\\(\hat{7} \\)) up and the 7th and 5th of the \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\) chord down. For the sake of consistency in terminology, the examples below label \\(\hat{7} \\), \\(\hat{2} \\), and the 7th of the chord. The incomplete I chord will have a tripled root and one 3rd.

     2. Incomplete \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\) (no fifth) to complete I.

  2. “Free” resolution: 

     1. If \\(\hat{7} \\) is not in the soprano part, you can resolve it down by the interval of a third to \\(\hat{5} \\).

In piano music you will sometimes find “improper” resolution of the 7th of a chord because it fits the hand better. This should be considered an exception and will not be acceptable in voice leading exercises completed for this class.

###  Subsection 27.3.1 Voice Leading \\(\left.\text{I}^{6}_{4}\right.\\) to \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\)

When \\(\left.\text{I}^{6}_{4}\right.\\) resolves to \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\), beware of parallel fifths if the fifth is above the root in the \\(\left.\text{I}^{6}_{4}\right.\\) chord. If it is, move all upper voices upward to the closest notes of the \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\) chord, or to an incomplete \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\) (no 5th).
