Figure 15.2.1.

Notice how Mozart expresses the various musical elements: 

Table 15.2.2. A Section, Second Movement, Eine kleine Nachtmusik

_Harmony_ | The key is C major   
---|---  
_Rhythm_ | The 8th note is most common rhythmic value, though the phrase begins with quarter-note values   
_Texture_ | The top two instruments are grouped together against a simple bass part   
_Articulation_ | Generally legato   
_Dynamics_ | Soft  
_Register_ | Neither extremely high nor low   
  
Here is the beginning of the second section (the B section):

Here are the most noticeable differences: 

Table 15.2.4. B Section, Second Movement, Eine kleine Nachtmusik

_Rhythm_ | 8th notes are the most common rhythmic value, with some 16th-note runs   
---|---  
_Texture_ | All four voices move in the same rhythm at the beginning of each subphrase   
_Articulation_ | Four staccato notes start each subphrase   
  
Now, look at the beginning of the next contrasting section (the C section):

The following elements are noticeably changed: 

Table 15.2.6. C Section, Second Movement, Eine kleine Nachtmusik

_Harmony_ | This section begins in C minor   
---|---  
_Rhythm_ | The accompaniment moves in 16th notes and the ornamentation of the second melody note (the turn) in the outer parts sounds as four 32nd notes   
_Texture_ | The middle two parts (Violin II and Viola) are paired together and the Violin I and Cello/Bass part engage in imitation   
_Articulation_ | The middle parts are played in a “separated” manner (more staccato than legato) and the motive in the outer voices starts with a staccato note   
  
Listen to how Mozart puts the entire form together, including transitional material to smooth out the changes from one section to another.
