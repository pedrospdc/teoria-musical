##  Section 10.6 Double Neighbor

The double neighbor (sometimes called a “neighbor group”) occurs when both the upper and lower neighbor occur before the return to the starting tone.

The double neighbor is sometimes confused with escape tones and appoggiaturas. Be sure to keep track of chord tones when analyzing non-chord tones. Look at the next example and ask yourself how you would analyze the harmony and non-chord tones on beat 4 of the first measure.
