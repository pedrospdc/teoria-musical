##  Section 26.10 Special Situations

Avoid parallel fifths when the _roots_ of triads are a second apart, as in the following examples: 

  1. \\(\left.\text{ii}^{6}\right.\\) to \\(\left.\text{I}^{6}_{4}\right.\\) (see the first measure in the examples below) 

  2. \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) to \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{6}\right.\\) (see the second measure the in examples below)

Figure 26.10.2. Parallel fourths as a corrective when roots are a 2nd apart

In any such situation where the roots are a second apart (even if the chords are inverted), revoice each chord so the 5th of the chord is _below_ the root of the chord in the upper voices
