##  Section 11.4 Phrase

Musical form is full of sections, and the phrase is the smallest category of section. Unlike a motive, a phrase gives the sense of completing a formal unit. 

In classical music, phrases always end with [cadences](cadences.html "Section 7.4: Cadences"); if you have encountered a cadence, you have just witnessed the completion of a phrase. In popular music, a phrase might be completed by a melody reaching four measures in length or by completing a line of lyric instead of by a cadence. 

To generalize (or perhaps over-generalize), most of the phrases you encounter will be four measures in length and will end with one of [the four cadence types](cadences.html "Section 7.4: Cadences") (authentic cadence, half cadence, deceptive cadence, and, less commonly, the plagal cadence). While four- and eight-measure phrases are the most common, you will also encounter phrases that are five, six, and seven measures in length. Less commonly, you will encounter three-measure phrases. 

Here are examples of four-measure phrases. Notice that these phrases have a sense of completion even though they do not end with cadences.

Here is an example of a five-measure phrase. Notice that the final chord (a minor iv chord, which will be discussed in the chapter on mode mixture) is part of a half cadence or deceptive cadence, yet the phrase has a feeling of completion, especially considering its relation to the phrases before and after it.

Examples of seven-measure phrases are rare and often involve [elisions](Elision.html "Section 13.7: The Elision"), which will be covered in a later [chapter](PhrasesInCombination.html "Chapter 13: Phrases in Combination") when we discuss how phrases are combined to create small forms like [periods](PeriodForm.html "Section 13.3: The Period") and [phrase groups](PhraseGroupsAndPhraseChains.html "Section 13.6: Phrase Groups and Phrase Chains").
