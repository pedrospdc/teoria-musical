##  Section 16.3 The Cadential Six-Four Chord

A common term in music theory—the “cadential six-four” (or cadential \\(\left.\text{}^{6}_{4}\right.\\))—is used to refer to the \\(\left.\text{I}^{6}_{4}\right.\\) that regularly proceeds the \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) chord in cadences.

It is worth remembering that the cadential \\(\left.\text{}^{6}_{4}\right.\\) (or \\(\left.\text{I}^{6}_{4}\right.\\)) has [dominant function](HarmonicFunction.html#DominantFunction "Item 2"), just like the \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) chord that usually follows it. Previously, we have called this chord “\\(\left.\text{I}\middle/\text{5th}\right.\\).” 

We will use the term “cadential six-four” throughout the rest of this text, now that figured bass has been introduced.
