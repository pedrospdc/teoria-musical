##  Section 26.12 Summary of Doubling Rules for Triads

To generalize, here are the doubling rules for voice leading triads in root position, first inversion, and second inversion: 

  * Root Position Chords: DOUBLE THE BASS 

  * First-Inversion Chords: DO NOT DOUBLE THE BASS

    * Exception: \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{6}\right.\\)and \\(\left.\text{ii}^{\circ}{}^{6}\right.\\): DOUBLE THE BASS 

    * Exception: Consecutive first inversion chords—alternate between DOUBLE THE BASS and DO NOT DOUBLE THE BASS 

  * Second-Inversion Chords: DOUBLE THE BASS
