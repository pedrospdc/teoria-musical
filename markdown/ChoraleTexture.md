##  Section 14.2 Chorale Texture

Chorale textures are those in which there is a chord for every (or nearly every) melody note. A familiar example of chorale texture is the “Star-Spangled Banner.”

Chorale textures are also described as “homorhythmic” because all of the parts move in the same rhythm.
