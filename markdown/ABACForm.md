##  Section 12.3 ABAC Form

Many popular songs from the 1930s–1950s were in the 32-bar ABAC form. Well-known examples include “[White Christmas](https://youtu.be/v5ryZdpEHqM),” “[Someday My Prince Will Come](https://youtu.be/fWN9UfUV9eE?t=38s),” and “[When I Fall In Love](https://youtu.be/jnRzMETUUAI).” 

“Star Dust” is an example of an ABAC form that is usually performed with a verse preceding the refrain.
