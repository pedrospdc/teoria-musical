##  Section 19.4 The Deceptive Cadence with ♭\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\)

The \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–♭\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\) deceptive cadence is a deceptive realization of a deceptive progression. This \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–♭\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\) cadence ties into the [♭\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\)–♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) progression](i-VII-VI-VII.html "Section 9.8: The i–VII–VI–VII Progression") to produce an “epic” (although somewhat clichéd) ending to the “Star Spangled Banner” as performed at the Super Bowl and Presidential Inaugurations by artists such as Whitney Houston, Beyoncé, and Lady Gaga, among others.

This same \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–♭\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\) deceptive cadence with ♭\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\) progressing to ♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) followed by \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) occurs in epic fashion at the end of the animated film Beauty and the Beast from 1991.
