##  Section 29.4 Voice Leading Augmented Sixth Chords

It may be helpful to [review the three types of augmented sixth chords](TypesOfAugmentedSixthChords.html "Section 21.2: Types of Augmented Sixth Chords") before discussing how one voice leads them. 

The salient accidental in all three augmented sixth chords is ♯\\(\hat{4} \\), which almost always resolves upward to \\(\hat{5} \\).

The ♯\\(\hat{4} \\) scale degree also resolves to \\(\hat{5} \\) when an augmented sixth chord resolves to the Cadential \\(\left.\text{}^{6}_{4}\right.\\) chord.

With the enharmonic German augmented sixth chord (abbreviated \\(\left.\text{EnGer}^{+6}\right.\\), containing ♭\\(\hat{6} \\), \\(\hat{1} \\), ♯\\(\hat{2} \\), and ♯\\(\hat{4} \\)), ♯\\(\hat{2} \\) and ♯\\(\hat{4} \\) resolve upward to members of a major \\(\left.\text{I}^{6}_{4}\right.\\) chord.

The exception to ♯\\(\hat{4} \\) to \\(\hat{5} \\) occurs when an augmented sixth chord resolves to \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\), in which case ♯\\(\hat{4} \\) resolves to ♮\\(\hat{4} \\), which is the 7th of the \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\) chord.

If you voice lead an augmented sixth chord to something other than \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\), \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\), or \\(\left.\text{i}^{6}_{4}\right.\\), move all of the voices smoothly while avoiding objectionable parallels and employing proper doublings.
