##  Section 6.3 Inverted Triads

An inverted triad does not have the root as the lowest note. It is important to distinguish between _root_ and _bass_. The root of a chord is the lowest note _when the notes are stacked in thirds_. The _bass_ is the lowest note, which might be the root, third, or fifth. 

A triad is in “root position” when the root is the lowest note, “first inversion” when the third of the chord is the lowest note, and “second inversion” when the fifth of the chord is the lowest note.

###  Subsection 6.3.1 "Slash" Chords

In lead-sheet notation, an inverted chord has the triad before the slash (/) and the bass note after it. “\\(\left.\text{C}\middle/\text{E}\right.\\)” means a \\(\text{C}\\) triad with an \\(\text{E}\\) as the lowest note. Therefore, a slash chord has a bass note that is not the root of the chord. In fact, it is possible to have slash chords where the bass note is not one of the chord tones (e.g., \\(\left.\text{C}\middle/\text{F}^{♯}\right.\\)).

Remember, in a slash chord, _the first letter you see represents the root of the chord_. The letter _after_ the slash is the _lowest_ note (the bass). 

_Lead-sheet Symbol_ | _Root of Chord_ | _Notes in the Chord_ | _Bass Note (Lowest Note)_  
---|---|---|---  
\\(\left.\text{F}\middle/\text{A}\right.\\) | \\(\text{F}\\) |  \\(\text{F}\\)–\\(\text{A}\\)–\\(\text{C}\\) | \\(\text{A}\\)  
\\(\left.\text{D}\text{m}\middle/\text{A}\right.\\) | \\(\text{D}\\) |  \\(\text{D}\\)–\\(\text{F}\\)–\\(\text{A}\\) | \\(\text{A}\\)  
\\(\left.\text{G}^{\circ}{}\middle/\text{D}^{♭}\right.\\) | \\(\text{G}\\) |  \\(\text{G}\\)–\\(\text{B}^♭\\)–\\(\text{D}^♭\\) | \\(\text{D}^♭\\)  
\\(\left.\text{C}{+}\middle/\text{G}^{♯}\right.\\) | \\(\text{C}\\) |  \\(\text{C}\\)–\\(\text{E}\\)–\\(\text{G}^♯\\) | \\(\text{G}^♯\\)
