##  Chapter 17 Secondary Dominant Chords

So far we have studied [diatonic harmony](DiatonicChordsInMajor.html "Section 7.2: Diatonic Chords in Major") (chords without accidentals, with the exception of the use of raised \\(\hat{6} \\) and \\(\hat{7} \\) in minor, which are considered diatonic). In the following chapters, we will study _chromatic_ harmony.
