##  Section 31.10 How to Determine Chord-Scale Relationships

To discover a chord-scale relationship for almost any chord, write all of the notes of the chord (including upper extensions and altered notes), then fill in the thirds with the most logical choices, _avoiding augmented seconds and consecutive half steps_. 

In the example below, we determine the scale that best fits \\(\left.\text{G}{\Delta}^{7}\left(\text{♯11}\right)\right.\\) by doing the following: 

  1. Identify the notes in the chord 

  2. Write all chord tones as a scale within the span of an octave 

  3. Fill in any gaps, avoiding augmented 2nds and consecutive half steps 

  4. Analyze the resulting scale

Figure 31.10.1. How to Determine a Scale for a Chord

The G Lydian scale is the most correct scale to play over \\(\left.\text{G}{\Delta}^{7}\left(\text{♯11}\right)\right.\\). 

###  Principle 31.10.2. Determining Chord-Scale Relationships.

When constructing the scale, avoid augmented seconds and consecutive half steps 

###  Subsection 31.10.1 List of Chord-Scale Relationships

Below is a list of common chord-scale relationships. When there are two scales listed for a single chord, it is because the chord has a minor third that can be filled with half step then whole step _or_ whole step then half step. This knowledge of chord-scale relationships ultimately becomes second nature to an improvising jazz musician. 

Table 31.10.3. List of Chord-Scale Relationships

CHORD | CORRESPONDING SCALE(S)  
---|---  
\\(\left.\text{C}{\Delta}^{7}\right.\\) | C major scale or C Lydian scale  
\\(\left.\text{C}{\Delta}^{7}\left(\text{♯11}\right)\right.\\) | C Lydian scale  
\\(\left.\text{C}{\Delta}^{7}\left(\text{♯5}\right)\right.\\) | C Lydian-Augmented scale  
\\(\left.\text{C}\text{m}^{7}\right.\\) | C dorian scale or C natural minor  
\\(\left.\text{C}^ø{}^{7}\right.\\) | C locrian scale or C locrian ♯2  
\\(\left.\text{C}^ø{}^{9}\right.\\) | C locrian ♯2  
\\(\left.\text{C}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\\) | C Octatonic Whole-Half  
Cm\\(\left.\text{}{\Delta}^{7}\right.\\) | C melodic minor ascending  
Cm\\(\begin{smallmatrix}6\\\9\end{smallmatrix}\\) | C Dorian or C melodic minor ascending  
\\(\left.\text{C}^{7}\right.\\) | C Mixolydian  
\\(\left.\text{C}^{7}\left(\text{♯11}\right)\right.\\) | C Lydian-Dominant  
\\(\left.\text{C}^{7}\left(\text{♯5}\right)\right.\\) | C Whole Tone scale  
\\(\left.\text{C}^{7}\left(\text{♭5}\right)\right.\\) | C Whole Tone scale  
\\(\left.\text{C}^{7}\left(\text{♭9}\right)\right.\\) | C Octatonic (Half-Whole)  
\\(\left.\text{C}^{7}\left(\text{♯9}\right)\right.\\) | C Octatonic (Half-Whole)  
\\(\left.\text{C}^{13}\left(\begin{smallmatrix}\text{♯11}\\\\\text{♯9}\end{smallmatrix}\right)\right.\\) | C Octatonic (Half-Whole)  
\\(\left.\text{C}^{7}\right.\\)alt | C Diminished-Whole Tone  
  
This list is not exhaustive. Follow the process above (“How to Determine Chord-Scale Relationships”) for chords not on this list. 

Additionally, it is often important to look at the relationship of a chord to the overall key of a tune to determine the appropriate scale. For example, the \\(\left.\text{F}\text{min}^{7}\right.\\) at the beginning of “All The Things You Are” by Jerome Kern is the \\(\left.\text{vi}^{7}\right.\\) chord in A♭ major, in which case it would be inappropriate to play F Dorian because the D♮ would conflict with the D♭ in the key signature. One would play F natural minor (or Aeolian) instead.
