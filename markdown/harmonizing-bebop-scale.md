##  Section 31.11 Harmonizing the Bebop Scale

In The Jazz Theory Book, author Mark Levine provides a method for harmonizing the bebop major scale (\\(\hat{1} \\)–\\(\hat{2} \\)–\\(\hat{3} \\)–\\(\hat{4} \\)–\\(\hat{5} \\)–\\(\hat{♯5} \\)–\\(\hat{6} \\)–\\(\hat{7} \\)–\\(\hat{8} \\)) with four voices. 

Try singing through each part—soprano, alto, tenor, then bass.

Notice that all of the non-tonic chords are \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\\) chords in various inversions. 

One hears a similar approach to harmonizing a scale (though without the fully-diminished seventh chords as passing chords) in the following example.
