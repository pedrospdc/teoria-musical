  2. Determine the root of the \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\) in the key of B♭ (the Roman numeral _after_ the slash): _F_

  3. Build a major–minor seventh chord on F: _F–A–C–E_ ♭ 

  4. Invert the chord accordingly. \\(\left.\text{}^{4}_{3}\right.\\) inversion means the fifth of the chord is in the bass.
