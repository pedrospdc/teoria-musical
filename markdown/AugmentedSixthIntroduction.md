##  Section 21.1 Augmented Sixth Chords

Augmented sixth chords are a special class of [pre-dominant](HarmonicFunction.html#PreDominantFunction "Item 3") chords with notes that approach the dominant (\\(\hat{5} \\)) from a half-step below (♯\\(\hat{4} \\)) and from a half-step above (♭\\(\hat{6} \\)) simultaneously.

In minor, ♭\\(\hat{6} \\) doesn’t require a flat because \\(\hat{6} \\) is lowered in the minor key signature.
