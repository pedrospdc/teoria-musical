##  Section 4.2 Durational Symbols

In the present day, the most common time signature is \\(\begin{smallmatrix}4\\\4\end{smallmatrix}\\) (also known as “common time”). It makes sense to introduce durational symbols in the context of \\(\begin{smallmatrix}4\\\4\end{smallmatrix}\\) because a whole note takes up a whole measure in \\(\begin{smallmatrix}4\\\4\end{smallmatrix}\\), a half note takes up half a measure of \\(\begin{smallmatrix}4\\\4\end{smallmatrix}\\), a quarter note takes up \\({1\over 4}\\) of a measure, and so on.

Here are durational symbols for rests.

To put this information into practice, listen to the durational values double in speed in each measure of the following example. 

![Each measure has values twice as fast as the previous, from quarter notes to 32nd notes](external/images/unit1/durational-values-doubling.svg)

Two rare durational values are the double whole note (also called a “breve”) and the 64th note, which is twice as fast as a 32nd note.
