##  Section 1.4 Accidentals

There are five types of accidentals; accidentals are characters that can be placed before notes to raise or lower them.

  * The sharp symbol—♯—raises a pitch a half step. 

  * The flat symbol—♭—lowers a pitch a [half step](HalfStepsAndWholeSteps.html "Section 2.1: Half Steps and Whole Steps"). 

  * The double sharp symbol—𝄪—raises a pitch two half steps, or a [whole step](HalfStepsAndWholeSteps.html "Section 2.1: Half Steps and Whole Steps"). 

  * The double flat symbol—𝄫—lowers a pitch two half steps, or a whole step. 

  * The natural symbol—♮—cancels out any other accidentals that may have occurred earlier in a measure or in [Major Key Signatures](MajorKeySignatures.html "Section 2.3: Major Key Signatures") or [Minor Key Signatures](MinorKeySignatures.html "Section 3.2: Minor Key Signatures").
