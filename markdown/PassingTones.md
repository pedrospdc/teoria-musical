Passing tones are notes that pass between chord tones.

In the first bar of the “Want to Want Me” example, the passing tone is unaccented. In the third bar, it is accented (on the beat). The non-chord tone in bar 2 is an [appoggiatura](Appoggiatura.html "Section 10.4: Appoggiatura"). 

There can be two consecutive diatonic passing tones in a descending scale segment from the root and fifth of a chord.
