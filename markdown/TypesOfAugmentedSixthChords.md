##  Section 21.2 Types of Augmented Sixth Chords

There are three general types of augmented sixth chords—the Italian augmented sixth chord (“\\(\left.\text{It}^{+6}\right.\\)”), the French augmented sixth chord (“\\(\left.\text{Fr}^{+6}\right.\\)”), and the German augmented sixth chord (“\\(\left.\text{Ger}^{+6}\right.\\)”). These geographic labels have persisted throughout the years despite the fact that no reasoning has been found for these designations.  1 

The 1964 Harvard Dictionary of Music states these chords are “rather pointlessly…distinguished as ‘Italian,’ ‘German,’ and ‘French’ sixth…”

All types of augmented sixth chords contain scale degrees ♭\\(\hat{6} \\) and ♯\\(\hat{4} \\). To these two scale degrees, the \\(\left.\text{It}^{+6}\right.\\) adds \\(\hat{1} \\). The three notes of the \\(\left.\text{It}^{+6}\right.\\) (♭\\(\hat{6} \\), ♯\\(\hat{4} \\), and \\(\hat{1} \\)) form the foundation of the \\(\left.\text{Fr}^{+6}\right.\\) and \\(\left.\text{Ger}^{+6}\right.\\). The \\(\left.\text{Fr}^{+6}\right.\\) adds \\(\hat{2} \\) to the Italian augmented sixth chord’s ♭\\(\hat{6} \\), ♯\\(\hat{4} \\), and \\(\hat{1} \\), and the \\(\left.\text{Ger}^{+6}\right.\\) adds ♭\\(\hat{3} \\) to the Italian’s ♭\\(\hat{6} \\), ♯\\(\hat{4} \\), and \\(\hat{1} \\), as is shown in the example below.

The final chord on the first line—the Enharmonic German \\(\left.\text{}^{+6}\right.\\) or \\(\left.\text{EnGer}^{+6}\right.\\)—respells the ♭\\(\hat{3} \\) as a ♯\\(\hat{2} \\) because the \\(\left.\text{EnGer}^{+6}\right.\\) resolves only to major \\(\left.\text{I}^{6}_{4}\right.\\). The \\(\left.\text{EnGer}^{+6}\right.\\) does not occur in minor.
