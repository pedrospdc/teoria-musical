##  Section 22.5 How to Recognize a Key After a Modulation

Look for the following cues when examining music containing modulations: 

  1. Look for recurring accidentals, then add them to the key signature to determine the new key

     1. Lowered notes (like flats) usually create \\(\hat{4} \\) (as do the flats in key signatures) 

     2. Raised notes (like sharps) often create \\(\hat{7} \\), the leading tone

        1. If there are multiple raised notes, look for the “sharpest of sharps” (in key signature order) to determine which sharp is acting as \\(\hat{7} \\)

  2. If accidentals are canceled out, they indicate tonicizations or chromatic non-chord tones
