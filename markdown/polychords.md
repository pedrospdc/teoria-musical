##  Section 32.4 Polychords

A polychord typically consists of two triads sounding simultaneously. A polychord could also consist of two seventh chords, or a seventh chord and triad. Additionally, a polychord could conceivably consist of more than two triads or seventh chords, since the prefix “poly” means “many.” 

Perhaps the most famous polychord is the “Rite of Spring chord,” an E♭\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\) chord sounding over an F♭ major chord, which occurs during the “Dance of the Adolescents.”

Polychords are notated using a horizontal line between the chords instead of a slash. (The slash was used for slash chords (see [Subsection 6.3.1](InvertedTriads.html#SlashChords "Subsection 6.3.1: "Slash" Chords").)

Also note that it is not necessary to specify the inversion of each of the chords in the polychord. 

In th example below, Copland voices an A major chord below an E major chord.
