##  Section 5.5 Augmented and Diminished Intervals

Augmented intervals are one half step _larger_ than perfect or major intervals and diminished intervals are one half step _smaller_ than perfect or minor intervals. 

Remember that perfect intervals (unisons, fourths, fifths, and octaves) can never be major or minor, and major and minor intervals (seconds, thirds, sixths, and sevenths) can never be perfect in quality. However, any size of interval can be augmented or diminished.
