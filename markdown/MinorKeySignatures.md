##  Section 3.2 Minor Key Signatures

Minor key signatures agree with the notes of the natural minor scale. Since the \\(\text{C}\\) natural minor scale had \\(\text{E}^♭\\), \\(\text{A}^♭\\), and \\(\text{B}^♭\\), the key signature of C minor has three flats, written in the order of flats—\\(\text{B}^♭\\), \\(\text{E}^♭\\), \\(\text{A}^♭\\).

Therefore, a minor key signature will have three lowered notes—the 3rd, 6th, and 7th—in relation to the corresponding major key signature. We use the term parallel minor when referring to a minor scale that _has the same 1st scale degree_ (in this case \\(\text{C}\\)) as the major. We say, “The parallel minor of \\(\text{E}\\) major is \\(\text{E}\\) minor,” and “The parallel major of \\(\text{F}\\) minor is \\(\text{F}\\) major.” One method of figuring out a minor key signature is to add three flats to the parallel major key signature. This is the same as subtracting three sharps.

Note on uppercase versus lowercase: When writing below the five-line staff to designate keys, we will use the shorthand of upper case for major (\\(\left.\text{C}\right.\\)) and lowercase for minor (\\(\left.\text{c}\right.\\)). When writing prose, we will use uppercase: C major and C minor. 

We use the term relative minor when referring to a minor key that _has the same key signature_ as a major key. For example, the relative minor of \\(\text{E}^♭\\) major is \\(\text{C}\\) minor because both have three flats in the key signature. Conversely, one could say the relative major of \\(\text{C}\\) minor is \\(\text{E}^♭\\) major. The relative major is three half steps _above_ the relative minor.

Below are the minor key signatures.

Here are circle of fifths diagrams for both major and minor, for comparison.

Writing harmonic minor and melodic minor scales _when using minor key signatures_ requires you to _raise_ scale degrees.

Compositions in minor typically do not strictly use only one of the three minor scales, however. The three minor scales are distillations of composers’ actual practice.
