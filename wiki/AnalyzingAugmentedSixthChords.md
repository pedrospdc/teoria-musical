##  Seção 21.3 Analyzing Augmented Sixth Acordes

Since our process for analyzing acordes has been to stack them up in thirds to determine the root and quality, it is worth examing these four augmented sixth acordes as stacks of thirds.

Figura 21.3.1. Augmented Sixth Acordes Stacked in Thirds

Notice that all augmented sixth acordes contain a \\(\left.\text{}^{\circ}{}\right.\\)3 when stacked in 3rds. None of the acordes we have studied so far contain diminished thirds. 

###  Principle 21.3.2. Augmented Sixth Acordes.

When you encounter a acorde with a diminished third, it is an augmented sixth acorde. 

Once you determine the acorde you are analyzing has a \\(\left.\text{}^{\circ}{}\right.\\)3, _analyze the escala degrees_ to determine which type of augmented sixth acorde it is.
