##  Seção 30.4 Third Species Contraponto

In third species, one writes four quarter notas to each whole nota in the cantus firmus. Use the following rules. 

  1. Begin on an oitava or unison. Write four quarter notas to each whole nota in the cantus firmus except for the final compasso. 

  2. End on a whole nota on an oitava or unison with the penultimate compasso using one of the following formulas:

     1. If the cantus firmus is in the inferior voice, the penultimate compasso of the superior voice can be:

        1. \\(\hat{4} \\)–\\(\hat{5} \\)–\\(\hat{6} \\)–\\(\hat{7} \\), or 

        2. \\(\hat{2} \\)–\\(\hat{1} \\)–\\(\hat{6} \\)–\\(\hat{7} \\) (the _cambiata_ —see 5.b. below) 

     2. If the _cantus firmus_ is in the superior part, the penultimate compasso of the inferior voice is \\(\hat{7} \\)–\\(\hat{5} \\)–\\(\hat{6} \\)–\\(\hat{7} \\).

  3. Each downbeat should be a consonance. 

  4. When crossing barlines, apply the following:

     1. “Imperfect” consonances (3rds and 6ths) can be approached in any manner. 

     2. “Perfect” consonances (unisons, 5ths, 8ves, 12ths) may only be approached in contrary motion in order to avoid direct 5ths and direct 8ves. 

     3. Do not repeat notas across barlines 

  5. Allowable dissonances:

     1. Passing tones are allowable dissonances (but never on the first beat of the compasso). 

     2. The _cambiata_ (see the melodic contour in third compasso of the example below) is allowed but only with the second nota of the compasso as the only dissonant intervalo. 

  6. Direct 5ths and direct 8ves are not allowed and occur when an 8ve or 5th on a downbeat is approached through similar motion.
