##  Seção 26.1 Condução de Vozes

Condução de vozes, also known as part writing, refers to rules about melodic motions of voices involved in harmonic progressions. The primary concerns behind condução de vozes rules are independence of parts, voicing of acordes, and economy of melodic motion for the sake of singable parts. 

“SATB” condução de vozes refers to four-part acordes scored for soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B) voices. Three-part acordes are often specified as SAB (soprano, alto, bass) but could be scored for any combination of the three voice types. SATB condução de vozes will also be referred to as “chorale-style” condução de vozes.
