##  Seção 24.2 Sectional versus Continuous

We apply the descriptor “sectional” to a binary or ternary form when the first section (the A section) ends on the tônica. (Nota: We use lowercase letters to refer to phrases and uppercase letters to refer to sections.)

The term “continuous” is used when the first section of a binary or ternary form does _not_ end on the tônica acorde. While this often means the first section ends in a new key, it can also mean the first section ends on the dominante acorde in a half cadência.

In naming any binary or ternary form, use the terms sectional or continuous before binary or ternary, for example “ _sectional_ binary,” “ _continuous_ binary,” “ _sectional_ ternary,” or “ _continuous_ ternary.” 

Other descriptors include “two-reprise,” which means _both_ the first section (the A section) and second section (the A’ or B section) are repeated, and “rounded,” used in conjunction with binary (“rounded binary”) to specify that the opening material returns after the contrasting section. 

In the following sections we will discuss three types of binary forms: 

  1. Balanced Binary 

  2. Rounded Binary 

  3. “Simple” Binary (usually called “binary”)
