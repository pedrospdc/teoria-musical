##  Seção 5.2 How to Identify Perfect, Major, and Minor Intervalos

Here are two methods for identifying intervalos. 

The first method involves thinking of the inferior nota of an intervalo as the tônica (the first nota of the escala). Remember that all the notas above the tônica in a escala maior are perfect or major. Determine if the superior nota is in the escala maior. If it is not, determine if the intervalo is a semitom smaller than a major intervalo, in which case it is a minor intervalo.

If the inferior nota of an intervalo has a sustenido or bemol on it, cover up the acidente, determine the intervalo, then factor the acidente back in.

The second method is to memorize how many half steps there are in each intervalo. To determine the size of an intervalo, count the number of half steps between the two notas then refer to your memory. 

Number of half steps | Name of intervalo | Number of half steps | Name of intervalo  
---|---|---|---  
1 | m2 | 7 | P5  
2 | M2 | 8 | m6  
3 | m3 | 9 | M6  
4 | M3 | 10 | m7  
5 | P4 | 11 | M7  
6 | Tritone* | 12 | P8  
  
* A “tritone” is a generic name for an augmented fourth (\\(\left.\text{}{+}\right.\\)4) or diminished fifth (\\(\left.\text{}^{\circ}{}\right.\\)5). These two intervalos are enharmonic. [Augmented and Diminished Intervalos](AugmentedAndDiminishedIntervals.html "Seção 5.5: Augmented and Diminished Intervalos") are discussed later in this chapter.
