##  Seção 35.2 Phase Shifting

Minimalist composer Steve Reich conceived of phase shifting in his early work in tape music, noting that tape loops of slightly differing lengths containing the same idea went slowly out of phase and very gradually back into phase when they were repeated incessantly (see [It’s Gonna Rain](https://youtu.be/vWN9I-qa9GQ) from 1965 and [Come Out](https://youtu.be/aVXc9Veo_B8) from 1966). Reich applied this phase–shifting process to live performance in [Piano Phase](https://youtu.be/6sU-_Sw1Fwo) (1967), [Violin Phase](https://youtu.be/RjxSoQeZYAY) (1967), and [Clapping Music](https://youtu.be/LReT8K11bac) (1972).

Below is the basic twelve–nota padrão of Piano Phase along with a video demonstrating the phase–shifting.

During the phase–shifting process, one can think of the inferior voices in the examples above as going through rotation. The example below shows rotation of a five–nota padrão. The padrão rotates one nota to the left, meaning the second nota begins the padrão on the second line, the third nota begins the padrão on the third line, etc., until the first nota starts the padrão again to complete the phase–shifting process.

Figura 35.2.3. Rotation demonstrated with a five–nota padrão

In a piece of music, the process would play out similar to the manner below, where one part maintains the original padrão while the second goes out of phase by continually rotating the original padrão one nota to the left. In Piano Phase, Reich has the second pianist gradually increase in speed so the padrões go slowly out of phase, while in Clapping Music, Reich has the musicians change to the next rotation on the downbeat of a compasso, without gradually speeding up.

One hears phase shifting in numerous works by Reich, including the second movement of his Three Movements.

It is worth mentioning that composers like Stravinsky applied rotation to serialism, which Joseph Straus details in Capítulo 6 of his Introduction to Post–Tonal Analysis (4th edition).
