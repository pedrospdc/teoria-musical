##  Seção 26.7 Condução de Vozes Root Position Tríades in Four Parts

We are writing in four parts but tríades have three notas. We will double the root of every root position acorde. (The root is in the bass when a tríade is in root position, so we are doubling the bass nota in an superior part.) 

###  Principle 26.7.1. Doubling rule for root position tríades.

Always double the root in root position tríades. 

To move from one acorde to the next, consider the intervalo that occurs melodically in the bass line between the current acorde and subsequent one. 

###  Subsection 26.7.1 Bass movement of the intervalo of a 3rd or 6th

In the superior three parts (soprano, alto, and tenor): retain the two common tones and move the other voice by step

###  Subsection 26.7.2 Bass movement of the intervalo of a 4th or 5th

In the superior three parts, do one of the following: 

  1. Retain the common tone and move the other two voices by step

  2. Move all of the superior voices in the same direction (each superior voice will move by a 2nd or 3rd to the mais próxima acorde member in the second acorde)

###  Subsection 26.7.3 Bass movement of the intervalo of a 2nd

Move the three superior parts in contrary motion to the bass line.

There is one exception, which leads us to the following principle: 

####  Principle 26.7.4. Condução de vozes the deceptive progressão.

When the bass moves by the intervalo of a 2nd in the deceptive progressão in the minor mode (V–VI in C minor), _always_ move the 3rd of the V acorde up by step while the other notas (the 5th and the doubled root) move in contrary motion to the bass. 

In this situation, two voices move in an upward direction and two voices move in a downward direction. This results in a doubled 3rd in the VI acorde. In the major mode, use this voice-leading solution if \\(\hat{7} \\) is in the soprano voice (because it is a tendency tone—see [Item 1](RulesOfMelody.html#TendencyTones "Item 1") in [Seção 26.5](RulesOfMelody.html "Seção 26.5: Rules of Melody")).

The following two examples demonstrate the two possible ways to deal with the deceptive progressão in the major mode.

###  Subsection 26.7.4 Repetition of the bass nota

Repeat the superior three notas or arpeggiate the superior notas to different acorde members while maintaining the voicing of a doubled the root, one 3rd and one 5th.
