##  Seção 34.6 Non-Twelve-Tone Serialism

Serialism also includes music that is not twelve-tone but does use a series of notas that maintains its order and employs inversion, retrograde, and retrograde inversion of the series. An example is found in Stravinsky’s Septet from 1953. 1 

See Erwin Stein, “Strawinsky’s Septet (1953).” Tempo. Spring, 1954.

Figura 34.6.2. Series from Stravinsky’s Septet

Here is the series with altura-class integers (abbreviated “pc” for altura class), and without registral displacement. Arrows connect repeated notas.

Figura 34.6.3. Series from Stravinsky’s Septet showing repeated pitches

We notice that B (altura integer 11), A (9), G (7), F♯ (6), and G♯ (8) are repeated in the series, with A, G, and G♯ occurring three times each. Below is the normal form of the 8 altura classes in the 16-nota series.

Such a series could imply E or A as a tonal center. Nota that Stravinsky’s Septet is not strictly serial but contains serial elements. Such an example shows us that serialism can be employed in ways other than the strict, original twelve-tone version.
