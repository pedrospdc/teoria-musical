##  Seção 27.5 When to Use Seventh Acordes

In your harmonizations of melodies, it is best to use seventh acordes to add tension as you approach tônica function. Therefore, sevenths are added most frequently to acordes of dominante function (\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) and \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\)) and acordes of pre–dominante function (\\(\left.\text{ii}\right.\\) and, to a lesser extent, \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)). (See the [harmonic flowchart](HarmonicFunction.html#HarmonicFlowchart "Subsection 9.4.1: The Harmonic Flowchart").) For this reason, seventh acordes like \\(\left.\text{iii}^{7}\right.\\), \\(\left.\text{vi}^{7}\right.\\), \\(\left.\text{IV}\text{M}^{7}\right.\\), and \\(\left.\text{I}\text{M}^{7}\right.\\) are less commonly used and encountered.
