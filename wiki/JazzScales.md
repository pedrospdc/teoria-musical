##  Seção 31.9 Scales

In this section on escalas, our primary concern will be understanding how escalas relate to corresponding acordes in order to allow one to improvise a jazz solo. Similarly, understanding acorde-escala relationships can allow one to write chordal solos (like a sax soli or shout chorus in a jazz ensemble piece) where non-acorde tones come from the corresponding escala. 

###  Subsection 31.9.1 The Blues Escala

The blues escala is identical to the minor pentatonic escala (\\(\hat{1} \\)–♭\\(\hat{3} \\)–\\(\hat{4} \\)–\\(\hat{5} \\)–♭\\(\hat{7} \\)) except with an added ♭\\(\hat{5} \\)/♯\\(\hat{4} \\) (\\(\hat{1} \\)–♭\\(\hat{3} \\)–\\(\hat{4} \\)–♭\\(\hat{5} \\)–\\(\hat{5} \\)–♭\\(\hat{7} \\)).

Figura 31.9.1. The Blues Escala (Descending)

A well-known example of the blues escala occurs in “Sunshine of Your Love” by Cream.

In the blues escala, the ♭\\(\hat{5} \\) and ♭\\(\hat{3} \\) are considered to be “blue notas” because they are not acorde tones (of a major tríade or dominante 7th acorde). Blue notas are commonly used in jazz and popular music. 

In terms of using the blues escala as a soloist, you will find that some players use the blues escala over any and every acorde, and that listeners’ ears often find this acceptable. 

###  Subsection 31.9.2 The Bebop Escala

The bebop escala (known more specifically as the “bebop dominante” escala in jazz theory texts) is identical to the [Mixolydian escala](JazzScales.html#TableOfScales "Subsection 31.9.3: Tabela of Scales") except is has an added ↑\\(\hat{7} \\). The added chromatic nota (↑\\(\hat{7} \\)) occurs in descending passages (from \\(\hat{8} \\)–\\(\hat{7} \\)–♭\\(\hat{7} \\)) as a chromatic passing tone. The bebop escala is most often used over the dominante 7th acorde. In the most rudimentary form of improvising, one can use the bebop escala in descending eighth notas beginning on the downbeat of a compasso, starting on the root, 3rd, 5th, or 7th.

###  Subsection 31.9.3 Tabela of Scales

The escalas below are represented by escala degrees. Synthetic escalas like whole tone, diminished, and diminished-whole tone have many acceptable enharmonic respellings.
