###  Subsection 22.7.1 Direct Modulation

Direct modulation (also known as phrase modulation) is a type of modulation where a composer decides to move suddenly to a new key without using pivot acordes or preparing the new tônica with its dominante.

In the example below from the second song of the same song cycle as the example above, Schubert does not attempt to change gradually from C minor to A♭ major, but instead stops on a half cadência in C minor and begins on the tônica in A♭ major in the next compasso.

Direct modulation is the most common type of “modulation” found in popular music. At the beginning of this chapter we defined this type of modulation in popular music as “key change.”

With direct modulation, composers do not make any attempt to connect two different keys through any pivot acordes or common tones. In the next section, we examine how composers connect two keys through a common tone. 

###  Subsection 22.7.2 Common-Tone Modulation

In common-tone modulation, two acordes are connected through a single nota to bridge the distância between two keys. 

In the following example, the nota C♯ acts as a hinge between a C♯ major acorde (\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) in F♯ minor) and an A dominante seventh acorde (\\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\) in D major).

In the next example, the nota A acts as a hinge between an A major acorde (\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) in D minor) and an F major acorde (\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) in F major).

####  Subsubsection 22.7.2.1 Chromatic Mediants

In a common-tone modulation, the two acordes connecting the two keys are typically in a chromatic mediant relationship. Chromatic mediants are acordes with roots a third apart that share only one common tone and have the same quality (both are major or both are minor).

Figura 22.7.6. Chromatic mediant relationship in [Figura 22.7.5](ModulationsWithoutPivotChords.html#D898 "Figura 22.7.5")

Any major or minor tríade will have four chromatic mediants, as shown in the example below.

Figura 22.7.7. Chromatic mediants of the C major and C minor tríades

Below are examples chromatic mediants that do not involve modulation. In fact, the progressão in the following three examples are found in the last compasso of [Figura 22.7.7](ModulationsWithoutPivotChords.html#chromatic-mediants "Figura 22.7.7"), the progressão from \\(\left.\text{i}\right.\\) to ♭\\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\) (mostrada como Cm to A♭m in the example above).

###  Subsection 22.7.3 Sequential Modulation

Modulation can also be accomplished by sequence. In a sequential modulation, a melody and its accompanying harmonies are repeated at a new altura level to establish or lead to a new key. In the following example, the sequence of the original idea occurs in the new key.

Figura 22.7.11. Beethoven, Piano Sonata Op. 2, No. 1, III. (1795)

In the following example, an idea in C major is repeated up a step in D major, then up another step in E minor before reaching an F♯\\(\left.\text{}^{\circ}{}\right.\\) acorde, a acorde with dominante function in G major.

Figura 22.7.12. Mozart, Oboe Concerto in C major, K. 314, III. (1777)

In the next example, after a cadência in G minor, an idea in F minor is repeated down a tom inteiro in E♭ minor to achieve the change of key to E♭ major, which is the starting key of this aria, as can be seen in the armadura de clave.

While this is by no means an exhaustive list of modulatory techniques, it should give you a sense of some of the different means composers use to change keys.
