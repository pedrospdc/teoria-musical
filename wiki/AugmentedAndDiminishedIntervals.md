##  Seção 5.5 Augmented and Diminished Intervalos

Augmented intervalos are one semitom _larger_ than perfect or major intervalos and diminished intervalos are one semitom _smaller_ than perfect or minor intervalos. 

Remember that perfect intervalos (unisons, fourths, fifths, and octaves) can never be major or minor, and major and minor intervalos (seconds, thirds, sixths, and sevenths) can never be perfect in quality. However, any size of intervalo can be augmented or diminished.
