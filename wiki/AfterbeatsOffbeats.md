##  Seção 14.5 Afterbeats and Offbeats

###  Subsection 14.5.1 Afterbeats

The term “afterbeats” is from Fundamentals of Musical Composition by noted composer and pedagogue Arnold Schoenberg. “Afterbeats” are repeated acordes (usually eighth notas, sometimes quarter notas) that occur after the downbeat.

In the next example, the afterbeats are not repeated acordes but instead are passing-tone figures harmonized in thirds.

###  Subsection 14.5.2 Offbeats

Offbeats are typically acordes that occur regularly on upbeats, avoiding downbeats. While there are many styles of music that use chordal offbeats, in this section we will consider only polka and reggae styles. 

####  Subsubsection 14.5.2.1 Polka

The polka, which originated in Bohemia, has connotations with Germary and Oktoberfest. The polka in the United States is often associated with Frankie Yankovic, who was known as the “Polka King.”

####  Subsubsection 14.5.2.2 Reggae

Reggae is associated with the island of Jamaica and, in terms of texture, is characterized by offbeats, often played on an electric guitar. Bob Marley is closely associated with reggae music.
