##  Seção 9.4 Harmonic Function

Now we will address non-circle-of-fifths progressions. Notice that we have not included the \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\) or \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) acorde in any of the shorter circle of fifths progressions above. However, it is a common axiom that Rock ‘n’ Roll is made up of three acordes: \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\), \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\), and \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\). This is because each of those acordes represents a harmonic function. Harmonic function refers to the tendency of certain acordes to progress to other acordes, or to remain at rest. Many texts on music theory enumerate three harmonic functions. In this text, we will discuss four.

  1. [Tônica](ScaleDegreeNames.html "Seção 3.3: Escala Degree Names") function (abbreviated “ton.”): The \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) acorde has tônica function, which is a state of stability and rest. Tônica acordes do not demand progressão to other acordes. 

  2. Dominante function (abbreviated “dom.”): The \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) and \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\) (acordes containing the leading tone \\(\hat{7} \\) and supertonic \\(\hat{2} \\)) tend to progress to tônica (\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)). _Special note_ : The \\(\left.\text{I}\middle/\text{5th}\right.\\) acorde has _dominant_ function when it resolves to the \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) acorde, as in the third acorde from the end of the “Star-Spangled Banner.”

  3. Pre-dominante function (abbreviated “pre-dom.”): The \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) and \\(\left.\text{ii}\right.\\) (acordes containing the subdominante \\(\hat{4} \\) and submediant \\(\hat{6} \\)) tend to progress to acordes of dominante function. 

  4. Tônica prolongation function (abbreviated “ton. prol.”): The \\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\) and \\(\left.\text{iii}\right.\\) (acordes that share two common tones with \\(\hat{1} \\)–\\(\hat{3} \\)–\\(\hat{5} \\) from the tônica tríade) tend to occur after the tônica acorde and progress to acordes of pre-dominante function. 

Harmonic function is represented on a flowchart in the next section.

###  Subsection 9.4.1 The Harmonic Flowchart

![Harmonic Flowchart in Major](external/images/unit2/harmony-function-diagram-major.svg)

Figura 9.4.2. Harmonic Flowchart in Major

Remember that \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) goes to \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) in the [plagal cadência](cadências.html#PlagalCadence "Item 2") and \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) goes to \\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\) in the [deceptive cadência](cadências.html#DeceptiveCadence "Item 3"). When \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) goes to \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\), label \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) as having _tonic prolongation_ function. _The plagal cadência and deceptive cadência are exceptions to the harmonic flowchart_. 

Here is the Harmonic Flowchart in minor. Nota the addition of the subtonic \\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) acorde, which has one function—to progress to \\(\left.\text{III}\right.\\).

Figura 9.4.3. Harmonic Flowchart in Minor

The tônica acorde \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) can progress directly to a acorde of any other function and, in fact, many pieces begin with a \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) progressão, representing harmonic function of Tônica-Dominante-Tônica. 

###  Subsection 9.4.2 Tônica-Dominante-Tônica Progressão

This is the most elemental progressão in music, often realized with \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\).

The principle of “Tônica-Dominante-Tônica” could also be represented with \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\). Even though we learned that “dominante” means “\\(\hat{5} \\)” (and also “\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)”) in [earlier sections](ScaleDegreeNames.html "Seção 3.3: Escala Degree Names"), “dominante _function_ ” in terms of harmony means “a acorde that _progresses to_ the tônica acorde.” We will revisit this concept and other possibilities for “dominante function” later. 

###  Subsection 9.4.3 Tônica-PreDominant-Dominante-Tônica Progressão

This sequence of harmonic functions can be realized in four possible ways:

  * \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{ii}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)

  * \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)

  * \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)

  * \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{ii}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)

Here are examples with \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{ii}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\).

Here are examples with \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) realizing the Ton-PreDom-Dom-Ton progressão.

Progressions using \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\) (\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) and \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{ii}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)) are less common because of the instability of diminished acordes. 

###  Subsection 9.4.4 The Tônica-Tônica Prolongation-PreDominant-Dominante Progressão

This progressão is most commonly realized with \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\), although in classical music one will often encounter \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{ii}\middle/\text{3rd}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) (mentioned [above](ShorterProgressionsFromTheCircleOfFifths.html#VI-II-V-I "Subsection 9.3.2: VI-II-V-I") in the section on \\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{ii}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) ). 

Notice the bass line starts with descending thirds.

Figura 9.4.15. Compare \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) to \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{ii}\middle/\text{3rd}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) (the bass lines are the same)

Here is a musical example with \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{ii}\middle/\text{3rd}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\).

####  Subsubsection 9.4.4.1 I–vi–IV–V

As mentioned earlier, the progressão \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) was so prevalent in the 1950s that it is known as the “’50s progressão” and the “’50s doo-wop progressão.” 

Listen for this bass line in the following examples. 

![](external/images/unit2/harmony-I-vi-IV-V-bass-line-in-C.svg)

Figura 9.4.17. \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) bass line in C major

  * Curtis Williams, Jesse Belvin, Gaynel Hodge, “Earth Angel” (in A-bemol major) (1954) 

  * Dolly Parton, “I Will Always Love You” (in A major) (1974) 

  * Johnny Ramone, Dee Dee Ramone, Joey Ramone, “Rock ‘n’ Roll High School” (in C major) (1978) 

In the above examples, the acordes have have half-nota [harmonic ritmo](HarmonicRhythm.html "Seção 9.2: Harmonic Ritmo"). In the following example, the acordes have whole-nota harmonic ritmo (4 beats per acorde).

  * John Stephens and Toby Gad, “All of Me” (in A-bemol major) (2013) 

The \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) progressão can also be rotated to \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\), as in the following example. 

![](external/images/unit2/harmony-I-vi-IV-V-rotated-rude.svg)

You will see more examples of Tônica-Tônica Prolongation-PreDominant-Dominante progressions, including the use of the \\(\left.\text{iii}\right.\\) acorde, in the Exercícios Práticos and the Homework. 

Remember, there are two exceptions in Harmonic Function: \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) has tônica prolongation function when it progresses to \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\), and \\(\left.\text{I}\middle/\text{5th}\right.\\) has dominante function when it progresses to \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\).
