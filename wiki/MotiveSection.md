##  Seção 11.1 Motive

A motive (or motif) is the smallest identifiable melodic idea in music. However, we will find times when it will be necessary to discuss a smaller fragment (called a “germ” by some authors) from a motive. 

In the following example from the first movement of Beethoven’s Symphony No. 1, we find four motives within the first four compassos of the primary theme.

Later in the movement we find Beethoven extracting motives from this four-compasso phrase in order to develop them through sequences ([Definition 9.1.11](CircleOfFifths.html#sequence-definition "Definition 9.1.11")). 

Here is development of motive 1.
