##  Seção 29.2 Condução de Vozes Borrowed Acordes

[Borrowed acordes](ModeMixtureSection.html "Seção 19.1: Mode Mixture"), or acordes making use of mode mixture, are handled similarly to their diatonic versions in terms of condução de vozes, e.g., \\(\left.\text{ii}^ø{}^{7}\right.\\) is handled similarly to \\(\left.\text{ii}^{7}\right.\\). In any of the borrowed acordes with ♭\\(\hat{6} \\), resolve this tendency tone down by step whenever possible.

Another situation where you may encounter a borrowed acorde is the \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–♭\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\) cadência, which should be handled the same as the deceptive cadência in minor (see [Principle 26.7.4](VoiceLeadingFourPartsRootPosition.html#voice-leading-deceptive-cadência "Principle 26.7.4: Condução de vozes the deceptive progressão"))—resolve the 3rd of the \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) acorde up by step and move the other two voices in contrary motion to the bass. 

There are no specific rules for other borrowed acordes such as ♭\\(\left.\text{III}\right.\\), ♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\), \\(\left.\text{i}\right.\\), and \\(\left.\text{v}\right.\\); simply voice lead them as smoothly as possible while avoiding objectionable parallels.
