##  Seção 16.1 Historical Context

In the Baroque era in music (roughly 1600–1750 C.E.), a shorthand was developed for writing acordes. (Lead-sheet symbols are the modern shorthand for representing acordes). Figured bass (also known as thoroughbass) consists of a bass line notated on a pauta accompanied by numbers representing intervalos to be played above the bass nota within the armadura de clave. (These figured-bass numbers are traditionally notated below the bass line.)

Like lead-sheet symbols, figured bass allowed a keyboardist or guitarist freedom in choosing acorde voicings. While some early music specialists perform from scores with the original notation, editions of Baroque compositions by composers like J.S. Bach and Handel that were originally notated with figured bass have been “realized” or written out in modern editions. 

In the present day, figured bass is taught in music theory courses primarily as a shorthand for acorde inversion symbols (although many music programs also endeavor to teach students to perform at the piano music written with figured bass notation).
