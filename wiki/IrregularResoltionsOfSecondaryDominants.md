##  Seção 17.6 Irregular Resolutions of Secondary Acordes

The roots of secondary dominants do not always resolve down a perfect fifth to the tonicized acorde. In many of the examples of popular music with secondary dominants at the beginning of this chapter, the secondary dominants resolve deceptively.

In “Yesterday,” the \\(\left.\text{V}\middle/\text{V}\right.\\) resolves not to \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) but to \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\), which sometimes acts as a substitute for the \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) acorde (the dominante) in popular music. 

This progressão also happens in “Forget You,” where a \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\middle/\text{V}\right.\\) resolves to a \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) acorde.

In “I Want You to Want Me” by Cheap Trick, the \\(\left.\text{V}\middle/\text{V}\right.\\) acorde resolves to a subtonic ♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) acorde in A major.

Remember, however, that the subtonic ♭\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) in major can act as a substitute for the dominante (see the [Harmonic Flowchart for Popular Music with Subtonic \\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) acorde in Major](SubtonicVIIinPopMusic.html#SubtonicVIIFlowchart "Figura 9.6.1")). 

In “Baby Love” by the Supremes, a \\(\left.\text{C}^{7}\middle/\text{B}^{♭}\right.\\) in C major (\\(\left.\text{V}^{4}_{2}\middle/\text{IV}\right.\\)) resolves to an \\(\left.\text{A}^{7}\right.\\) acorde (\\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\middle/\text{ii}\right.\\)), which then resolves to \\(\left.\text{ii}\right.\\) (\\(\left.\text{Dm}\right.\\)). In this example, notice that the B♭ in the \\(\left.\text{C}^{7}\middle/\text{B}^{♭}\right.\\) is a lowered chromatic nota that wants to resolve downward by semitom to A. Instead of this A being the third of the \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) acorde (an F major acorde), which is the traditional and expected resolution, it is the root of an \\(\left.\text{A}^{7}\right.\\) acorde (\\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\middle/\text{ii}\right.\\)).

Finally, a rather common deceptive resolution of a secondary dominante is \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\middle/\text{vi}\right.\\) to \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\), which can be seen in the following three examples.

There are two ways to conceptualize this progressão. The first is that the progressão of \\(\left.\text{iii}\right.\\) to \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) (Em to F in C major) is not unusual, so E to F, which appears to be \\(\left.\text{III}\right.\\) to \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) but is in fact \\(\left.\text{V}\middle/\text{vi}\right.\\) to \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\), is a chromatic modification of \\(\left.\text{iii}\right.\\) to \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\). The other way to think of \\(\left.\text{V}\middle/\text{vi}\right.\\) to \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) is as \\(\left.\text{V}\middle/\text{vi}\right.\\) to \\(\left.\text{VI}\middle/\text{vi}\right.\\), a deceptive progressão within the submediant area. 

We can conclude that secondary acordes do not always resolve strictly to the acordes they appear to be tonicizing.
