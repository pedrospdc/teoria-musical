##  Seção 7.4 Cadences

We’ve been studying harmony—tríades and acordes. A cadência is a harmonic arrival point, a harmonic moment of stasis. A cadência can be compared to a comma or period in written language—the ear gets a moment to process a short passage of music, then the music continues. We will differentiate between four basic cadências now, adding [more specificity in a later chapter](PerfectAuthenticCadence.html "Seção 13.1: The Perfect Authentic Cadência").

  1. Authentic Cadência (AC): a phrase ending with the acordes \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)

  2. Plagal Cadência (PC): a phrase ending with the acordes \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)

  3. Deceptive Cadência (DC): a phrase ending with the acordes \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)

  4. Half Cadência (HC): a phrase ending on the \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) acorde

In the example above, the notas surrounded by parentheses are [non-acorde tones](NonChordTones.html "Capítulo 10: Non-Acorde Tones"), which will be studied later. Also, there are [seventh acordes](SeventhChords.html "Capítulo 8: Seventh Acordes") in this example, which we will study in the next chapter. 

Here is another example ending with an authentic cadência.

The following example, from the prelude to Act I of Richard Wagner’s opera Tristan und Isolde, is arguably one of the most famous deceptive cadências in the history of classical music.

Figura 7.4.8. Wagner, Tristan und Isolde, Prelude to Act I

A deceptive cadência means \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) did not go to \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\). This means that “\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) to not-\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)” is technically a more correct description for a deceptive cadência than \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)-\\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\), which is the most common realization of “\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) to not-\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\).” 

In the example below, \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) goes to \\(\left.\text{IV}\middle/\text{3rd}\right.\\).

You may encounter acordes with no thirds in rock and pop music. If you encounter a acorde that has only a root and fifth, label it with a “5” after the root in lead sheet labeling (e.g., \\(\left.\text{B}^{5}\right.\\), as in the next example). 

Additionally, you may encounter incomplete acordes. 

####  Definition 7.4.12.

Incomplete acordes are acordes containing only the root and third but no fifth.
