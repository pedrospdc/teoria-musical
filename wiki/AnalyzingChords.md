##  Seção 6.4 Analyzing Acordes

When a three-nota acorde is represented by four or more notas (some of which are duplicates of the original three notas) and spread out across a grand pauta, we can arrive at a lead-sheet symbol by answering three questions: 

  1. What is the root of the acorde? 

  2. What is the quality of the acorde (i.e., is the acorde major, minor, diminished, or augmented)? 

  3. What is the bass nota (i.e., is the acorde inverted)? 

To determine the root of the acorde, write all the notas only on the lines of the pauta em clave de sol (you may need to use ledger lines).

You could also choose to write all the notas only on the spaces in a pauta.

The bottom nota is the root when the acorde is stacked as a tríade. In this case, the root is \\(\text{D}\\). 

Next, determine the quality of the tríade (major, minor, diminished, or augmented) by analyzing if there is a M3 or m3 from the root to the 3rd, and if there is a M3 or m3 from the 3rd to 5th.

Since there is a m3 (3 half steps) from \\(\text{D}\\) to \\(\text{F}\\) and a M3 (4 half steps) from \\(\text{F}\\) to \\(\text{A}\\), the tríade is minor. 

Finally, determine if the acorde is inverted by checking to see if a nota other than the root is the lowest nota. Since the bass nota (lowest nota) is the root \\(\text{D}\\), the acorde is not inverted. The acorde is in root position, so the lead-sheet symbol is \\(\left.\text{D}\text{m}\right.\\). 

Now, try the process again.

On scratch paper, stack the notas only on lines in the treble clave to determine the root. 

![](external/images/unit1/tríades-analyzing-2nd-acorde-stacked.svg)

The root is \\(\text{E}\\). 

Analyze the quality of the tríade by measuring from \\(\text{E}\\) to \\(\text{G}\\) and from \\(\text{G}\\) to \\(\text{B}^♭\\).

It is an \\(\text{E}\\) diminished tríade (\\(\left.\text{E}^{\circ}{}\right.\\)). 

Finally, determine if the acorde is inverted. Is the root (\\(\text{E}\\)) the lowest nota? 

![](external/images/unit1/tríades-analyzing-2nd-acorde-to-try.svg)

Since the lowest nota is \\(\text{G}\\), the acorde is inverted. Our lead-sheet symbol is \\(\left.\text{E}^{\circ}{}\middle/\text{G}\right.\\), which means we have an \\(\left.\text{E}^{\circ}{}\right.\\) acorde with a \\(\text{G}\\) in the bass.
