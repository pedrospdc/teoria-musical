##  Seção 1.2 Notation

Notas are written on a five-line pauta. A clave orients the lines to a reference point. For example, the G clave, when placed on a five-line pauta, becomes the treble clave, the most well known clave. In treble clave, the notas on the lines are \\(\text{E}\\)–\\(\text{G}\\)–\\(\text{B}\\)–\\(\text{D}\\)–\\(\text{F}\\) from lowest to highest, often remembered through the traditional mnenomic “Every Good Boy Does Fine.” The spaces are \\(\text{F}\\)–\\(\text{A}\\)–\\(\text{C}\\)–\\(\text{E}\\) from lowest to highest. Staves (the plural of “pauta” in musical terminology is “staves”) are extended by the ledger lines.

The F clave, when placed on a five-line pauta with the dots surrounding the second line from the top, creates the bass clave. See the example for the names of lines and spaces, and for mnemonics to remember them.
