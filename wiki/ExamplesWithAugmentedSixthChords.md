##  Seção 21.5 Examples with Augmented Sixth Acordes

###  Subsection 21.5.1 The Italian Augmented Sixth Acorde

The first examples, from the first movement of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, shows an Italian augmented sixth acorde (\\(\left.\text{It}^{+6}\right.\\)) in C minor with the “classical” spelling.

The next example from popular music has an \\(\left.\text{It}^{+6}\right.\\) spelled enharmonically as a major-minor seventh acorde with the fifth omitted.

###  Subsection 21.5.2 The French Augmented Sixth Acorde

The next example contains an example of a French augmented sixth acorde (\\(\left.\text{Fr}^{+6}\right.\\)). Notice how the French augmented sixth acorde has pre-dominante function and intensifies the drive toward the \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) acorde.

###  Subsection 21.5.3 The German Augmented Sixth Acorde

The following example, from Rossini’s William Tell Overture, has a German augmented sixth acorde leading to a acorde of dominante function, the \\(\left.\text{I}^{6}_{4}\right.\\) acorde.

John Coltrane’s minor blues, “Mr. P.C.,” contains a German augmented sixth acorde (spelled as \\(\left.\text{VI}^{7}\right.\\) in minor) progressing to the \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) acorde. (Nota: The bass line in this example is a jazz “walking” bass, which doesn’t stick strictly to acorde tones.)

The next example is a movie theme and features a German augmented sixth acorde spelled as a major-minor seventh acorde (\\(\left.\text{VI}^{7}\right.\\)). In this particular case, the third of the acorde doesn’t occur until the fourth beat of the compasso.

Fiona Apple’s “Criminal,” from 1996, features German augmented sixth acordes in the verse (\\(\left.\text{F}^{7}\right.\\) in the key of A minor) as well as in the pre-chorus, seen in the example below.

A repeating progressão of \\(\left.\text{Am}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{F}^{7}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{E}\right.\\) (\\(\left.\text{i}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{Ger}^{+6}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) in Roman numerals) occurs in “Friend Like Me” from the movie and musical Aladdin.

###  Subsection 21.5.4 The Enharmonic German Sixth

In the following example an “Enharmonic German augmented sixth” acorde occurs. While a \\(\left.\text{G}^♭{}^{7}\right.\\) acorde would normally have the notas \\(\text{G}^♭\\)–\\(\text{B}^♭\\)–\\(\text{D}^♭\\)–\\(\text{F}^♭\\), the F♭ is respelled as an E♮, creating the intervalo of an augmented sixth, while the fifth of the acorde, D♭, is respelled as a C♯, creating the intervalo of a doubly augmented fourth. In fact, some music theory textbooks refer to the Enharmonic German augmented sixth acorde as “the acorde of the doubly-augmented fourth.” The spelling is this way because the C♯ will resolve upward to a D♮, the third of a major \\(\left.\text{I}^{6}_{4}\right.\\) acorde.
