##  Seção 35.1 Additive Minimalism

In Philip Glass’s version of additive minimalism as found at the beginning of his composition Two Pages (1969), he adds a repetition of a padrão but subtracts the final nota in the repetition. Each addition to the padrão is another repetition with the final nota of the previous repetition subtracted, as can be seen in the example below. (Nota: The music notation below is a transcription and analysis meant to show the additive process and is not necessarily how the music is written in the score.)

The following example from Music in Fifths (1969) clearly displays additive process on its own, but is just one of dozens of steps in an additive process.

To hear additive process in Glass’s well-known Einstein on the Beach, listen to the following minute of music from Act 1, Scene 1, “Train.” Each acorde in a five–acorde cadential progressão is gradually lengthened by adding to the number of subdivisions given to each acorde.
