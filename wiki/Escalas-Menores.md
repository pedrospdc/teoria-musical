##  Seção 3.1 Minor Scales

There are three minor escalas: the bequadro escala menor, the harmonic escala menor, and the melodic escala menor. Play or sing through each one and notice the differences.

The melodic escala menor has an ascending version, shown above, and a descending version that is the same as the bequadro escala menor.

So far, we have looked at minor escalas in relation to the escala maior. However, we will typically encounter minor escalas in music using minor armaduras de clave.
