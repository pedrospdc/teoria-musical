##  Seção 21.4 Lead-Sheet Analysis of Augmented Sixth Acordes

When using lead-sheet symbols for augmented sixth acordes, we will treat them as major-minor seventh acordes built on ♭\\(\hat{6} \\), since that matches the sonic quality of the augmented sixth acordes and is similar to how they occur and are spelled in jazz and popular music. The acordes in parentheses are enharmonic respellings of the three augmented sixth acorde types.

Figura 21.4.1. Augmented Sixth Acordes Stacked in Thirds

In the example above, we see a disagreement between “classical” analysis and lead-sheet analysis. The fundamental concept of lead-sheet analysis is to show root, quality, and inversion. The “classical” spelling and the classical analysis of augmented sixth acordes show the direction of resolution (with the chromatically raised notas), which necessitate the need for original labels, since we don’t have a Roman numeral or a lead-sheet symbol that would communicate a acorde containing a diminished third above the root (that is then inverted!). 

Therefore, when you are asked to provide lead-sheet symbols for augmented sixth acordes, analyze each one as if it is a dominante 7th acorde with a misspelled 7th (\\(\text{A}^♭\\)–\\(\text{C}\\)–\\(\text{E}^♭\\)–\\(\text{F}^♯\\) instead of \\(\text{A}^♭\\)–\\(\text{C}\\)–\\(\text{E}^♭\\)–\\(\text{G}^♭\\)).
