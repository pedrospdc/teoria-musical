##  Seção 7.1 Roman Numeral Acorde Symbols

Music is full of padrões that are similar from one piece to the next. As we saw with minor escalas, we were able to use escala degree numbers to show the different padrões for harmonic, melodic, and bequadro minor, despite the fact that there are 15 minor armaduras de clave. Using numbers instead of nota names helps us see these padrões. Thinking of music in terms of numbers is also helpful with transposition, which means moving melodies and/or acorde progressions from one key to another. Thinking of music in terms of numbers also helps us to analyze it and to spot similar padrões between many different pieces in different keys. 

We will use Roman numerals to represent acordes within a specified key. The Roman numeral “\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)” represents a tríade built on \\(\hat{1} \\), or the 1st nota of the escala. Uppercase Roman numerals represent major tríades and lowercase Roman numerals (e.g., “\\(\left.\text{i}\right.\\)”) represent minor tríades. Uppercase Roman numerals with a “\\(\left.\text{}{+}\right.\\)” are augmented (e.g., “\\(\left.\text{III}{+}\right.\\)”), and lowercase Roman numerals with a “\\(\left.\text{}^{\circ}{}\right.\\)” are diminished (e.g., “\\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\)”). (There is also the [Nashville Number System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_number_system), which uses Arabic numbers for acordes instead of Roman numerals.) 

_Key_ | _Lead-Sheet_ | _Root_ | _Scale Degree of Root_ | _Roman Numeral_ | _Notes in Chord_  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
\\(\text{G}\\) | \\(\left.\text{B}\text{m}\right.\\) | \\(\text{B}\\) | \\(\hat{3} \\) | \\(\left.\text{iii}\right.\\) |  \\(\text{B}\\)–\\(\text{D}\\)–\\(\text{F}^♯\\)  
\\(\text{f}\\) | \\(\left.\text{G}^{\circ}{}\right.\\) | \\(\text{G}\\) | \\(\hat{2} \\) | \\(\left.\text{ii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\) |  \\(\text{G}\\)–\\(\text{B}^♭\\)–\\(\text{D}^♭\\)  
\\(\text{c}\\) | \\(\left.\text{E}^♭{}\right.\\) | \\(\text{E}^♭\\) | \\(\hat{3} \\) | \\(\left.\text{III}\right.\\) |  \\(\text{E}^♭\\)–\\(\text{G}\\)–\\(\text{B}^♭\\)  
  
For inversion of Roman numerals, we will use a modified “slash acorde” notation until we study [Figured Bass](FiguredBass.html "Capítulo 16: Figured Bass"). For now, we will write “\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)/3rd” if the 3rd of the \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) acorde is the bass nota, for example.

The following table offers more examples. 

_Key_ | _Roman Num._ | _Root_ | _Scale Deg. of Root_ | _Notes in Chord_ | _Bass Note_  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
\\(\text{g}\\) | \\(\left.\text{V}\middle/\text{3rd}\right.\\) | \\(\text{D}\\) | \\(\hat{5} \\) |  \\(\text{D}\\)–\\(\text{F}^♯\\)–\\(\text{A}\\) | \\(\text{F}^♯\\)  
\\(\text{a}\\) | \\(\left.\text{iv}\middle/\text{5th}\right.\\) | \\(\text{D}\\) | \\(\hat{4} \\) |  \\(\text{D}\\)–\\(\text{F}\\)–\\(\text{A}\\) | \\(\text{A}\\)  
\\(\text{D}\\) | \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}\middle/\text{3rd}\right.\\) | \\(\text{C}^♯\\) | \\(\hat{7} \\) |  \\(\text{C}^♯\\)–\\(\text{E}\\)–\\(\text{G}\\) | \\(\text{E}\\)
