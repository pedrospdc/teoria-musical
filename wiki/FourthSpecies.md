##  Seção 30.5 Fourth Species Contraponto

Fourth species deals with writing suspensions (and syncopations). Because this is only a brief introduction to species contraponto, you will only encounter the cantus firmus in the inferior voice in fourth species in this text. See the fourth species rules below. 

  1. Start with a half rest, then write a half nota an 8ve above the _cantus firmus_. The half nota on the 3rd beat of every compasso but the penultimate one ties across the barline to a half nota on the first beat of the succeeding compasso. 

  2. End on a whole nota at the intervalo of an 8ve above the _cantus firmus_. 

  3. The penultimate compasso should contain a 7-6 suspension. 

  4. The half nota on the third beat of each compasso is _always_ a consonance. 

  5. If the half nota after a tie is a dissonance (4th or 7th), it is a suspension and _must resolve down by step_.

     1. Allowable suspensions in the superior part are 4-3 and 7-6; 9-8 and 2-1 are not allowed. 

  6. If the half nota after the tie is a consonance (1, 3, 5, 6, 8), it is a syncopation and can be left in any manner (by step or leap in any direction).

Notice that all suspensions and syncopations are labeled and all dissonant intervalos are circled.
