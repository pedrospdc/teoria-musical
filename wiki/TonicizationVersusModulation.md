##  Seção 22.2 Tonicization versus Modulation

Studying modulation will require us to distinguish between [tonicization](Tonicization.html "Seção 17.2: Tonicization"), which we studied recently, and modulation. Tonicization, involving secondary acordes, can be as short as two acordes (\\(\left.\text{V}\middle/\text{V}\right.\\) to \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\), for example) but can sometimes encompass several compassos as in the following example.

Below is a reduction showing the underlying diatonic progressão of the example above.

A modulation to a new key requires an eventual cadência to confirm that new key. This cadência will often (though not always) have the following cadential formula:

Figura 22.2.4. Audio Realization of Cadential Formula to Establish a Key

In his book Form in Tonal Music, Douglass Green defines a \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) authentic cadência with a pre-dominante prefix as a “full cadência.” 

The cadential formula above is found in the following example.

Figura 22.2.5. J.S. Bach, English Suite No. 4 in F Major, BWV 809, Sarabande (ca. 1715)

Notice that this cadential formula establishes a key more strongly than the simple \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) of an [authentic cadência](cadências.html#AuthenticCadence "Item 1"). This means there will be ambiguity between a tonicization and a short modulation ending in an authentic cadência, especially in music with fast harmonic ritmo, like Bach chorales (usually in quarter-nota [harmonic ritmo](HarmonicRhythm.html "Seção 9.2: Harmonic Ritmo")).

Figura 22.2.6. J.S. Bach, Christmas Oratorio, BWV 248, “Ermuntre dich, mein schwacher Geist,” (Chorale) (1734)

To determine pivot acordes and the new key, listen to the music to hear the cadência in the new key, then work backward from the cadência to see if the dominante in the new key was approached by pre-dominante acordes (\\(\left.\text{ii}\right.\\) or \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)) in the new key. Then, analyze from the beginning of the phrase until you reach the new key. Finally, look for a logical pivot point. Sometimes two successive acordes could logically be pivot acordes. If so, include two acordes on either side of your pivot bracket.

Before we start analyzing and writing modulations, we will examine key relationships and pivot acordes.
