##  Seção 1.5 Enharmonic Notas

Observe that \\(\text{C}^♯\\) and \\(\text{D}^♭\\) are the same nota no piano but are written as different notas na pauta.

This occurs with all the black keys no piano (\\(\text{C}^♯\\)=\\(\text{D}^♭\\), \\(\text{D}^♯\\)=\\(\text{E}^♭\\), \\(\text{F}^♯\\)=\\(\text{G}^♭\\), \\(\text{G}^♯\\)=\\(\text{A}^♭\\), \\(\text{A}^♯\\)=\\(\text{B}^♭\\)). When two notas _sound_ the same but are written as two different notas na pauta, the written notas are said to be enharmonic. Notas on the white keys of the piano can be written enharmonically as well (\\(\text{C}\\)=\\(\text{B}^♯\\), \\(\text{E}\\)=\\(\text{F}^♭\\), \\(\text{D}\\)=\\(\text{C}^𝄪\\), etc.).
