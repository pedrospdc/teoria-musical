##  Seção 6.1 Introduction to Tríades

A tríade consists of three notas stacked in consecutive thirds. A tríade is also called a acorde as well as a harmony. (Harmony also refers to acorde progressions.) 

The lowest nota of a tríade when it is stacked in thirds is called the root. The middle nota is the third and the highest nota of the tríade is the fifth. (We will discuss inversions of tríades later.)

There are four qualities of tríades—augmented, major, minor, and diminished.

Major and minor tríades are common, diminished tríades are less common, and augmented tríades are rare.
