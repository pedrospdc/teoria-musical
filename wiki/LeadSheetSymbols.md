##  Seção 6.2 Lead-Sheet Symbols

Lead-sheet symbols (also known as “lead-sheet notation” and “lead-sheet acorde symbols”) are often used as shorthand for acordes in popular music and jazz. These symbols allow a guitarist or pianist to choose how to “voice” the acordes, i.e., how they want to arrange the notas.

Lead-sheet symbols for tríades communicate the _root_ and _quality_ of a acorde. 

_Lead-sheet Symbol_ | _Chord Quality_ | _Notes in the Chord_  
---|---|---  
\\(\left.\text{F}\right.\\) | major |  \\(\text{F}\\)–\\(\text{A}\\)–\\(\text{C}\\)  
\\(\left.\text{G}\text{m}\right.\\) | minor |  \\(\text{G}\\)–\\(\text{B}^♭\\)–\\(\text{D}\\)  
\\(\left.\text{D}^{\circ}{}\right.\\) | diminished |  \\(\text{D}\\)–\\(\text{F}\\)–\\(\text{A}^♭\\)  
\\(\left.\text{C}{+}\right.\\) | augmented |  \\(\text{C}\\)–\\(\text{E}\\)–\\(\text{G}^♯\\)  
  
Here is a musical example with lead-sheet symbols and guitar tablature.

As you can see in the example above, major tríades are represented by an uppercase letter (\\(\left.\text{A}\right.\\), \\(\left.\text{E}\right.\\), and \\(\left.\text{D}\right.\\)) while minor tríades are represented with the root in uppercase followed by a lowercase “m” (e.g., \\(\left.\text{F}^♯{}\text{m}\right.\\)). Diminished tríades are represented by including the diminished symbol (\\(\left.\text{}^{\circ}{}\right.\\)) after the acorde root (e.g., \\(\left.\text{C}^{\circ}{}\right.\\)) while augmented tríades are represented by including the augmented symbol after the root (\\(\left.\text{C}{+}\right.\\)).
