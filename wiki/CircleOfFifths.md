##  Seção 9.1 The Circle of Fifths Progressão

The circle of fifths progressão (\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{iii}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{ii}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)) was a stalwart of the Baroque era in music. You will find many examples of this progressão in the music of Bach, Handel, and Vivaldi, especially in minor (\\(\left.\text{i}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{iv}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{III}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{ii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{i}\right.\\)) with the subtonic \\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\) (see [Definition 7.3.2](DiatonicChordsInMinor.html#subtonic-tríade-vs-leading-tone-tríade "Definition 7.3.2")).

This circle (the circle of fifths _for harmonic progression_) is different than the circle of fifths for armaduras de clave because this circle of fifths for _harmonic progression_ contains diatonic notas only. The circle of fifths for armaduras de clave ([Figura 2.3.4](MajorKeySignatures.html#circle-of-fifths-major "Figura 2.3.4")) contained all 12 notas of the chromatic escala.

Figura 9.1.3. Circle of Fifths for Harmonic Progressão

The circle of fifths (for harmonic progressão) is sometimes known as the “circle of _descending_ fifths.”

The circle of fifths progressão has been used regularly since the Baroque era.

The circle of fifths progressão has a feeling of inevitability about it because it consists of harmonic sequences. To understand harmonic sequence we will first look at melodic sequences, since the bass line is the “melody” in a harmonic sequence. Ask yourself what happens after this melodic idea:

###  Definition 9.1.11.

A sequence is a musical idea repeated at a different altura level. 

Sequences can be short or long. For example, look at this familiar idea and notice how all four compassos are sequenced down a step in the following four compassos. 

![Opening of Mozart’s 40th Symphony](external/images/unit2/harmony-melodic-sequence-mozart.svg)

Figura 9.1.12. Mozart, Symphony No. 40, I.

Now look again at the bass line in “Love You Like A Love Song” and notice how it can be thought of a two-nota idea treated as a descending sequence.

Figura 9.1.13. “Love You Like A Love Song” bass line sequence in groups of two notas

Sometimes we will hear a circle of fifths sequence where some of the acordes are not in root position, as in the [Handel](CircleOfFifths.html#handel-passacaglia "Figura 9.1.2") and [Mozart](CircleOfFifths.html#mozart-k545-st "Figura 9.1.5") examples. In these two examples, we are hearing the sequence of the roots, even though they are not clearly presented in the bass.

We will return to the idea of harmonic sequence later in this chapter.
