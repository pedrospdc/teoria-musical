##  Seção 8.1 Introduction to Seventh Acordes

A seventh acorde adds to a tríade another nota a third higher than the fifth. Acordes, being built in thirds, have members that are odd numbers—third, fifth, seventh, and we will eventually discuss extensions of the ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth. The fifteenth would be the double oitava, so acordes only extend as high as the thirteenth.

In classical and popular music, there are five types of seventh acordes commonly encountered:

  * the major seventh acorde 

  * the major-minor seventh acorde (also known as a dominante seventh acorde) 

  * the minor seventh acorde 

  * the half-diminished seventh acorde 

  * the fully-diminished seventh acorde (often called diminished seventh acorde)

Another way to differentiate between the five types of seventh acordes is by learning how the thirds are stacked in each one.

In later chapters we will discuss other seventh acordes built on augmented tríades and minor tríades.
