##  Seção 27.1 Condução de Vozes Seventh Acordes

There is one general rule for condução de vozes any seventh acorde: resolve the 7th of the acorde down by step. All other voices should move smoothly to the mais próxima acorde tone in a voicing containing the appropriate doubling. 

###  Principle 27.1.1. 7th acordes.

The one exception to this is in the progressão \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}^{4}_{3}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}^{6}\right.\\), which closes the theme of the first movement of Mozart’s Piano Sonata K. 331.

In the example below, one can see that the 7th resolves up by step.

Figura 27.1.5. The \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}^{4}_{3}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}^{6}\right.\\) progressão with acceptable parallel fifths

Notice that parallel fifths occur in this progressão because of the upward resolution of the 7th. These parallel fifths may have been deemed less objectionable because they consist of unequal fifths (where one of the fifths is in a case of parallel fifths is diminished).
