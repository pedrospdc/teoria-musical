##  Capítulo 12 Form in Popular Music

The overall form of a piece of popular music usually can be broken down into smaller 4-, 8-, 12-, or 16-compasso sections. The material in this chapter is informed by John Covach’s essay “[Form in Rock Music](https://works.hcommons.org/records/dfa04-7a910)” from Engaging Music: Essays in Music Analysis (ed. D. Stein).
