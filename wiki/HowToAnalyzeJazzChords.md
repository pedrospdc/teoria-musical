##  Seção 31.6 How to Analyze Jazz Acordes

To analyze a jazz acorde, on scratch paper write out all the _major_ acorde members up to the 13th. These include the major 3rd, perfect 5th, major 7th, major 9th, perfect 11th, and major 13th.

In order to analyze the following acorde, determine the following: 

  1. The quality of the 7th acorde 

  2. The superior structure (9, 11, and 13) 

  3. Any alterations to any of the acorde members 

  4. If any of the notas are enharmonically respelled

Work through each step (see the example below). Compare this acorde to the scratch paper version with all the major notas up to the 13th. We have an E♭ dominante 7th acorde. The G♭ can’t be the minor third because we already have a G♮. If we consider the G♭ enharmonically as an F♯, we see we have a ♯9, which we noted earlier is often spelled as ♭10 so as to agree chromatically with the ♭7. The A is the 11th, but it is an A♮, so it is a ♯11. It is not ♭5 because we would not have both a perfect 5th and altered 5th in the same acorde. There is no C in the acorde, so there isn’t a 13th.

The final label is E♭7\\(\left.\text{}\left(\begin{smallmatrix}\text{♯11}\\\\\text{♯9}\end{smallmatrix}\right)\right.\\). 

Let’s try another acorde.

Again, work through each step. First, write all the major notas up to the 13th.

Compare the “all major and perfect” 13th acorde above to the acorde to be solved.

We notice we don’t have an A, and we remember that we might have a sus acorde where the 4 (or sus4) substitutes for the 3rd. We see we have a B♭, which confirms this. We also do not see a C, but we remember that it is common to omit the 5th in a acorde (see “incomplete acordes” in [Definition 7.4.12](cadências.html#IncompleteChords "Definition 7.4.12")). Therefore we have F–B♭–E♭, making an F7sus acorde. When we examine for superior structure notas (the 9, 11, and 13), we find a G♭ (the ♭9 of the acorde) and a D (the 13). Remember, the B♭ is the sus (the 4th), not the 11th, because we have no 3rd (see “11 versus Sus” in [Seção 31.2](ChordSymbolSpecifics.html "Seção 31.2: Acorde Symbol Specifics")). 

The final label is F13sus(♭9). 

“F13” means we have root, 3rd, 5th, ♭7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th. “Sus” is a modifier that means we have the 4th, which eliminates the 3rd as well as the 11th because “sus” and 11 refer the same nota (B♭). “♭9” means the 9th is lowered chromatically.
