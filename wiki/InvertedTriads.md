##  Seção 6.3 Inverted Tríades

An inverted tríade does not have the root as the lowest nota. It is important to distinguish between _root_ and _bass_. The root of a acorde is the lowest nota _when the notas are stacked in thirds_. The _bass_ is the lowest nota, which might be the root, third, or fifth. 

A tríade is in “root position” when the root is the lowest nota, “first inversion” when the third of the acorde is the lowest nota, and “second inversion” when the fifth of the acorde is the lowest nota.

###  Subsection 6.3.1 "Slash" Acordes

In lead-sheet notation, an inverted acorde has the tríade before the slash (/) and the bass nota after it. “\\(\left.\text{C}\middle/\text{E}\right.\\)” means a \\(\text{C}\\) tríade with an \\(\text{E}\\) as the lowest nota. Therefore, a slash acorde has a bass nota that is not the root of the acorde. In fact, it is possible to have slash acordes where the bass nota is not one of the acorde tones (e.g., \\(\left.\text{C}\middle/\text{F}^{♯}\right.\\)).

Remember, in a slash acorde, _the first letter you see represents the root of the chord_. The letter _after_ the slash is the _lowest_ nota (the bass). 

_Lead-sheet Symbol_ | _Root of Chord_ | _Notes in the Chord_ | _Bass Nota (Lowest Nota)_  
---|---|---|---  
\\(\left.\text{F}\middle/\text{A}\right.\\) | \\(\text{F}\\) |  \\(\text{F}\\)–\\(\text{A}\\)–\\(\text{C}\\) | \\(\text{A}\\)  
\\(\left.\text{D}\text{m}\middle/\text{A}\right.\\) | \\(\text{D}\\) |  \\(\text{D}\\)–\\(\text{F}\\)–\\(\text{A}\\) | \\(\text{A}\\)  
\\(\left.\text{G}^{\circ}{}\middle/\text{D}^{♭}\right.\\) | \\(\text{G}\\) |  \\(\text{G}\\)–\\(\text{B}^♭\\)–\\(\text{D}^♭\\) | \\(\text{D}^♭\\)  
\\(\left.\text{C}{+}\middle/\text{G}^{♯}\right.\\) | \\(\text{C}\\) |  \\(\text{C}\\)–\\(\text{E}\\)–\\(\text{G}^♯\\) | \\(\text{G}^♯\\)
