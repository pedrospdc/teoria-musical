The \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) progressão occurs in many popular songs, has a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_containing_the_I%E2%80%93V%E2%80%93vi%E2%80%93IV_progression), and has been [mentioned in a New Yorker article](http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-bestseller-code-tells-us-what-we-already-know) about bestselling novels (see the third paragraph from the end of the article). The music group Axis of Awesome made [a compilation of several songs](https://youtu.be/oOlDewpCfZQ) with the \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) progressão that makes for an entertaining summary (warning: there is some language after the 5-minute mark). 

Here is a written-out example that includes the \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) progressão.

The \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) progressão can be rotated to become \\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) and \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\).

Figura 9.7.3. Example of \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\) rotation to \\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)

Here is an example with the \\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) progressão.

The \\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) progressão can also be thought of as being in minor: \\(\left.\text{i}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VI}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{III}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{VII}\right.\\)

Figura 9.7.5. “Best-Seller” Progressão with Roman Numerals in Major and Relative Minor

Whether you hear this progressão in major or minor depends on whether you hear the first acorde as the tônica or if you hear the third and fourth acorde as tônica and dominante. 

Here is an example with the \\(\left.\text{IV}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)–\\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\) progressão.
