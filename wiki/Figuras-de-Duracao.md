##  Seção 4.2 Durational Symbols

In the present day, the most common fórmula de compasso is \\(\begin{smallmatrix}4\\\4\end{smallmatrix}\\) (also known as “common time”). It makes sense to introduce durational symbols in the context of \\(\begin{smallmatrix}4\\\4\end{smallmatrix}\\) because a whole nota takes up a whole compasso in \\(\begin{smallmatrix}4\\\4\end{smallmatrix}\\), a half nota takes up half a compasso of \\(\begin{smallmatrix}4\\\4\end{smallmatrix}\\), a quarter nota takes up \\({1\over 4}\\) of a compasso, and so on.

Figura 4.2.1.

Here are durational symbols for rests.

To put this information into practice, listen to the durational values double in speed in each compasso of the following example. 

![Each compasso has values twice as fast as the previous, from quarter notas to 32nd notas](external/images/unit1/durational-values-doubling.svg)

Two rare durational values are the double whole nota (also called a “breve”) and the 64th nota, which is twice as fast as a 32nd nota.
