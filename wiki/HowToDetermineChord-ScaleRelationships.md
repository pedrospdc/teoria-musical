##  Seção 31.10 How to Determine Acorde-Escala Relationships

To discover a acorde-escala relationship for almost any acorde, write all of the notas of the acorde (including superior extensions and altered notas), then fill in the thirds with the most logical choices, _avoiding augmented seconds and consecutive half steps_. 

In the example below, we determine the escala that best fits \\(\left.\text{G}{\Delta}^{7}\left(\text{♯11}\right)\right.\\) by doing the following: 

  1. Identify the notas in the acorde 

  2. Write all acorde tones as a escala within the span of an oitava 

  3. Fill in any gaps, avoiding augmented 2nds and consecutive half steps 

  4. Analyze the resulting escala

Figura 31.10.1. How to Determine a Escala for a Acorde

The G Lydian escala is the most correct escala to play over \\(\left.\text{G}{\Delta}^{7}\left(\text{♯11}\right)\right.\\). 

###  Principle 31.10.2. Determining Acorde-Escala Relationships.

When constructing the escala, avoid augmented seconds and consecutive half steps 

###  Subsection 31.10.1 List of Acorde-Escala Relationships

Below is a list of common acorde-escala relationships. When there are two escalas listed for a single acorde, it is because the acorde has a minor third that can be filled with semitom then tom inteiro _or_ tom inteiro then semitom. This knowledge of acorde-escala relationships ultimately becomes second nature to an improvising jazz musician. 

Tabela 31.10.3. List of Acorde-Escala Relationships

CHORD | CORRESPONDING SCALE(S)  
---|---  
\\(\left.\text{C}{\Delta}^{7}\right.\\) | C escala maior or C Lydian escala  
\\(\left.\text{C}{\Delta}^{7}\left(\text{♯11}\right)\right.\\) | C Lydian escala  
\\(\left.\text{C}{\Delta}^{7}\left(\text{♯5}\right)\right.\\) | C Lydian-Augmented escala  
\\(\left.\text{C}\text{m}^{7}\right.\\) | C dorian escala or C bequadro minor  
\\(\left.\text{C}^ø{}^{7}\right.\\) | C locrian escala or C locrian ♯2  
\\(\left.\text{C}^ø{}^{9}\right.\\) | C locrian ♯2  
\\(\left.\text{C}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\\) | C Octatonic Whole-Half  
Cm\\(\left.\text{}{\Delta}^{7}\right.\\) | C melodic minor ascending  
Cm\\(\begin{smallmatrix}6\\\9\end{smallmatrix}\\) | C Dorian or C melodic minor ascending  
\\(\left.\text{C}^{7}\right.\\) | C Mixolydian  
\\(\left.\text{C}^{7}\left(\text{♯11}\right)\right.\\) | C Lydian-Dominante  
\\(\left.\text{C}^{7}\left(\text{♯5}\right)\right.\\) | C Whole Tone escala  
\\(\left.\text{C}^{7}\left(\text{♭5}\right)\right.\\) | C Whole Tone escala  
\\(\left.\text{C}^{7}\left(\text{♭9}\right)\right.\\) | C Octatonic (Half-Whole)  
\\(\left.\text{C}^{7}\left(\text{♯9}\right)\right.\\) | C Octatonic (Half-Whole)  
\\(\left.\text{C}^{13}\left(\begin{smallmatrix}\text{♯11}\\\\\text{♯9}\end{smallmatrix}\right)\right.\\) | C Octatonic (Half-Whole)  
\\(\left.\text{C}^{7}\right.\\)alt | C Diminished-Whole Tone  
  
This list is not exhaustive. Follow the process above (“How to Determine Acorde-Escala Relationships”) for acordes not on this list. 

Additionally, it is often important to look at the relationship of a acorde to the overall key of a tune to determine the appropriate escala. For example, the \\(\left.\text{F}\text{min}^{7}\right.\\) at the beginning of “All The Things You Are” by Jerome Kern is the \\(\left.\text{vi}^{7}\right.\\) acorde in A♭ major, in which case it would be inappropriate to play F Dorian because the D♮ would conflict with the D♭ in the armadura de clave. One would play F bequadro minor (or Aeolian) instead.
