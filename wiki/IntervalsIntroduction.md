##  Seção 5.1 Introduction to Intervalos

Intervalos are the building blocks of escalas, acordes (or harmonies), and melodies. Intervalos are a measurement between two pitches, either vertically or horizontally. When measuring vertically, we refer to harmonic intervalos because the two notas sound simultaneously. When measuring horizontally, we refer to melodic intervalos because the notas occur one after the other.

When you compasso from the tônica up to each escala degree of a escala maior, you find the following intervalos:

All intervalos in the example above are either “perfect” or “major.” 

###  Subsection 5.1.1 Numeric Size of Intervalo

There are two elements to naming intervalos: the quality and the number (for example, “major sixth,” abbreviated as “M6”). Let us first focus on the numeric size of intervalos. 

Odd-numbered intervalos will always be a line to a line or a space to a space.

Even-numbered intervalos will always be a space to a line or a line to a space.

###  Subsection 5.1.2 Intervalo Quality: Perfect versus Major/Minor

Intervalos such as the unison, fourth, fifth, and oitava can be classified as “perfect” but never “major” or “minor”. Conversely, the intervalos of the second, third, sixth, and seventh can be major or minor but never perfect in quality. 

_Perfect Intervals_ : | Unison, 4th, 5th, 8ve  
---|---  
_Major or Minor Intervals_ : | 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th  
  
Perfect intervalos are always bequadro to bequadro, sustenido to sustenido, and bemol to bemol except for the fourths and fifths between \\(\text{B}\\) and \\(\text{F}\\), which involve \\(\text{B}\\) to \\(\text{F}^♯\\) and \\(\text{B}^♭\\) to \\(\text{F}\\).

Minor intervalos are one semitom smaller than major intervalos.
