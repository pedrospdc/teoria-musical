##  Seção 5.3 How to Write Perfect, Major, and Minor Intervalos

To write an intervalo _above_ a given nota, use the two methods given below. 

If you are asked to write a minor sixth above the nota \\(\text{A}\\), start with the \\(\text{A}\\) escala maior and armadura de clave. In \\(\text{A}\\) major, there is an \\(\text{F}^♯\\), which is a major sixth above the nota \\(\text{A}\\). Therefore, \\(\text{F}^♮\\) is a minor sixth above \\(\text{A}\\).

Alternatively, you can simply count the number of half steps. If you know there are 8 half steps in a minor sixth, you can count from \\(\text{A}\\) up to \\(\text{F}\\). 

Writing small intervalos up to a major third _below_ a given nota is straightforward using a combination of whole and half steps. However, to write larger intervalos below a given nota, it is sometimes helpful to invert the intervalo first ([Inversion of Intervalos Explained](InversionOfIntervals.html "Seção 5.4: Inversion of Intervalos Explained") is discussed in the next section).
