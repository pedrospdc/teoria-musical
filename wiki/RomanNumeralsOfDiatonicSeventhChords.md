##  Seção 8.3 Roman Numerals of Diatonic Seventh Acordes

When notating seventh acordes with Roman numerals, there are a few conventions to follow. An uppercase Roman numeral means a major tríade and a lowercase Roman numeral means a minor tríade. Adding “7” after a Roman numeral means there is a minor seventh between the root and seventh of the acorde. Therefore, \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\) means a major tríade with a minor seventh between the root and seventh and \\(\left.\text{vi}^{7}\right.\\) means a minor tríade and a minor seventh between the root and seventh. Add “M7” for a major seventh acorde (e.g., \\(\left.\text{I}\text{M}^{7}\right.\\)). The half-diminished symbol (\\(\left.\text{}^ø{}^{7}\right.\\)) means there is a diminished tríade with a minor seventh from root to seventh. The diminished symbol (\\(\left.\text{}^{\circ}{}^{7}\right.\\)) on a seventh acorde means the tríade is diminished and the distância from the root to seventh is a diminished seventh. 

Below are the diatonic seventh acordes used in major and minor and their Roman numerals.
