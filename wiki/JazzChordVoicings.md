##  Seção 31.7 Jazz Acorde Voicings

In this section we will define guide tones and learn about two types of jazz acorde voicings. 

###  Subsection 31.7.1 Guide Tones

Guide Tones are the 3rd and 7th of a acorde. In any circle of fifths progressions (including ii–V–I and iii–vi–ii–V) the guide tones move by step.

Play through the entire circle of fifths with dominante 7th acordes (C7–F7–B♭7, etc.) with the bass nota in the left hand and the guide tones (3rd and 7th) in the right hand and observe how the 3rd and 7th are the same for bass notas a tritone from each other.

Also, you can play through the circle of fifths alternating between 7(13) acordes and 7(♯9) acordes—C7(13)–F7(♯9)–B♭7(13)–E♭7(♯9)—with the right hand descending chromatically. This can be repeated with all of the bass notas a tritone away (starting on F♯ in the left hand) and the qualities are exchanged for all the acordes.

###  Subsection 31.7.2 Jazz Acorde Voicings

In this section we will examine two categories of voicings. 

  1. The first category (“spread” voicings) has 5-nota acordes with the root, 3rd, and 7th as the lowest notas with other acorde members voiced above, often in the intervalo of a fourth or fifth. (The root will always be the lowest nota, while the 3rd can be voiced above or below the 7th). 

  2. The second category (“close” voicings) has 5-nota acordes with the bass nota in the left hand and the other four notas in “close position” in the right hand, usually with the 7th or 3rd of the acorde as the lowest nota in the right hand.

Some acordes (like sus acordes) do not have a 3rd, and some do not have or a 7th (like C\\(\left.\text{}^{6}\right.\\) or C\\(\begin{smallmatrix}6\\\9\end{smallmatrix}\\)). In those cases, voice the sus4 like you would the 3rd, and likewise voice the 6th as you would the 7th.

Sometimes you will need to omit the fifth to maintain five parts.
