##  Seção 32.4 Polychords

A polychord typically consists of two tríades sounding simultaneously. A polychord could also consist of two seventh acordes, or a seventh acorde and tríade. Additionally, a polychord could conceivably consist of more than two tríades or seventh acordes, since the prefix “poly” means “many.” 

Perhaps the most famous polychord is the “Rite of Spring acorde,” an E♭\\(\left.\text{}^{7}\right.\\) acorde sounding over an F♭ major acorde, which occurs during the “Dance of the Adolescents.”

Polychords are notated using a horizontal line between the acordes instead of a slash. (The slash was used for slash acordes (see [Subsection 6.3.1](InvertedTriads.html#SlashChords "Subsection 6.3.1: "Slash" Acordes").)

Also nota that it is not necessary to specify the inversion of each of the acordes in the polychord. 

In th example below, Copland voices an A major acorde below an E major acorde.
