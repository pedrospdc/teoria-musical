##  Seção 3.3 Escala Degree Names

Escala degrees, though often referred to by numbers, also have names. 

![For escala degree names, 1 is "tônica," 2 is "supertonic," 3 is "mediant," 4 is "subdominante," 5 is "dominante," 6 is "submediant," and 7 is "leading tone"](external/images/unit1/escala-degree-names.svg)

These names will be used throughout this text to refer to escala degrees, acordes built on these escala degrees, and keys associated with these escala degrees. 

Another way to understand why some escala degrees have “sub-” in their names is through the following example. 

![An example showing that the dominante is a 5th above tônica and the mediant is midway between them, and that the subdominante is a 5th below the tônica and that the submediant is midway between tônica and subdominante](external/images/unit1/escala-degrees-names-above-and-below.svg)

Notice that the _subtonic_ is a tom inteiro below the tônica, while the _leading tone_ is only a semitom below the tônica.
