##  Seção 17.2 Tonicization

In this chapter and the next, we will study tonicization, which means treating a acorde _other_ than the \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) acorde like a tônica by approaching it with its dominante. In diatonic harmony, the \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) acorde (the dominante) resolves to the \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) acorde (the tônica). A _secondary_ dominante is a major tríade or dominante seventh acorde that resolves to (or _tonicizes_) a acorde other than the \\(\left.\text{I}\right.\\) acorde.

Figura 17.2.1.

Sing the bass line of the example above and notice that a secondary acorde, through its chromaticism, intensifies the drive to the next acorde. 

###  Principle 17.2.2. Secondary Dominants.

The Roman numeral after the slash is the acorde being tonicized by the \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) acorde before the slash. 

You may find that you want to analyze the \\(\left.\text{D}^{7}\middle/\text{F}^{♯}\right.\\) in the example above as a \\(\left.\text{II}^{6}_{5}\right.\\) instead of a \\(\left.\text{V}^{6}_{5}\middle/\text{V}\right.\\) (which we pronounce as “\\(\left.\text{V}^{6}_{5}\right.\\) _of_ \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\)”), and the \\(\left.\text{E}^{7}\middle/\text{G}^{♯}\right.\\) as a \\(\left.\text{III}^{6}_{5}\right.\\) instead of \\(\left.\text{V}^{6}_{5}\middle/\text{vi}\right.\\) (“\\(\left.\text{V}^{6}_{5}\right.\\) _of_ \\(\left.\text{vi}\right.\\)”). Notice, however, that a \\(\left.\text{ii}\right.\\) acorde is typically minor in a major key and diminished in a minor key (\\(\left.\text{ii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\)), making uppercase \\(\left.\text{II}\right.\\) a chromatic harmony for which the proper label is \\(\left.\text{V}\middle/\text{V}\right.\\).

Figura 17.2.3.

While labeling \\(\left.\text{D}^{7}\right.\\) as \\(\left.\text{II}^{7}\right.\\) in C major makes the root clear, it does not communicate the function of the \\(\left.\text{D}^{7}\right.\\), which is to progress to a G major acorde (the \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\) acorde, or the dominante in C major). 

Also, notice that \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\) is not tonicized with its secondary dominante in the example above. Listen to the following example to understand why diminished acordes such as \\(\left.\text{vii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\) and \\(\left.\text{ii}^{\circ}{}\right.\\) in minor are not tonicized.
