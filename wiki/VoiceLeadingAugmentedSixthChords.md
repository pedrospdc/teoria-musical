##  Seção 29.4 Condução de Vozes Augmented Sixth Acordes

It may be helpful to [review the three types of augmented sixth acordes](TypesOfAugmentedSixthChords.html "Seção 21.2: Types of Augmented Sixth Acordes") before discussing how one voice leads them. 

The salient acidente in all three augmented sixth acordes is ♯\\(\hat{4} \\), which almost always resolves upward to \\(\hat{5} \\).

The ♯\\(\hat{4} \\) escala degree also resolves to \\(\hat{5} \\) when an augmented sixth acorde resolves to the Cadential \\(\left.\text{}^{6}_{4}\right.\\) acorde.

With the enharmonic German augmented sixth acorde (abbreviated \\(\left.\text{EnGer}^{+6}\right.\\), containing ♭\\(\hat{6} \\), \\(\hat{1} \\), ♯\\(\hat{2} \\), and ♯\\(\hat{4} \\)), ♯\\(\hat{2} \\) and ♯\\(\hat{4} \\) resolve upward to members of a major \\(\left.\text{I}^{6}_{4}\right.\\) acorde.

Figura 29.4.3. ♯\\(\hat{2} \\) and ♯\\(\hat{4} \\) resolving upward when in an \\(\left.\text{EnGer}^{+6}\right.\\)

The exception to ♯\\(\hat{4} \\) to \\(\hat{5} \\) occurs when an augmented sixth acorde resolves to \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\), in which case ♯\\(\hat{4} \\) resolves to ♮\\(\hat{4} \\), which is the 7th of the \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\) acorde.

If you voice lead an augmented sixth acorde to something other than \\(\left.\text{V}\right.\\), \\(\left.\text{V}^{7}\right.\\), or \\(\left.\text{i}^{6}_{4}\right.\\), move all of the voices smoothly while avoiding objectionable parallels and employing proper doublings.
