##  Seção 1.3 Oitava Registers

The nota names used in music are \\(\text{A}\\)\\(\text{B}\\)\\(\text{C}\\)\\(\text{D}\\)\\(\text{E}\\)\\(\text{F}\\)\\(\text{G}\\) (known as the “musical alphabet”). After \\(\text{G}\\), the nota \\(\text{A}\\) returns and \\(\text{A}\\)\\(\text{B}\\)\\(\text{C}\\)\\(\text{D}\\)\\(\text{E}\\)\\(\text{F}\\)\\(\text{G}\\) occurs again and again. The distância from the first \\(\text{A}\\) to the second \\(\text{A}\\) is an oitava (which means the notas are eight steps apart.) 

\\(\text{A}\\) | \\(\text{B}\\) | \\(\text{C}\\) | \\(\text{D}\\) | \\(\text{E}\\) | \\(\text{F}\\) | \\(\text{G}\\) | \\(\text{A}\\)  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
\\(1\\) | \\(2\\) | \\(3\\) | \\(4\\) | \\(5\\) | \\(6\\) | \\(7\\) |  \\(8\\) (oitava)  
  
The distância from any nota to a nota of the same name in the next register above or below is called an oitava (abbreviated “8ve”). 

How can the piano teclado have 88 notas when there are only seven nota names? The musical alphabet repeats 7 times (with an extra \\(\text{A}\\)\\(\text{B}\\)\\(\text{C}\\) at the top), which means we have at least seven oitava registers. (There are also five chromatic notas in each register, which we will learn about when we discuss [Acidentes](Acidentes.html "Seção 1.4: Acidentes").) When learning about oitava registers, we will focus on the nota \\(\text{C}\\) for reasons that will soon become clear when we learn about the escala maior. 

We use oitava registers (\\(\text{C}_{4}\\), \\(\text{D}_{5}\\), etc.) to specify the exact register of a nota. The nota \\(\text{C}_{4}\\) is known as “middle C” and is an important reference point. See the teclado in the example below.

Nota that _the register number changes after the note_ \\(\text{B}\\) each time (\\(\text{B}_{4}\\) is followed by \\(\text{C}_{5}\\)). 

In treble clave, middle \\(\text{C}\\) is notated on the ledger line below the pauta. In bass clave, middle \\(\text{C}\\) is notated on the ledger line above the pauta.

The other two commonly used clefs are alto clave and tenor clave. Each use a \\(\text{C}\\) clave that, when placed on a pauta, designate the placement of middle \\(\text{C}\\).

The grand pauta, which is a treble and bass clave joined together by a bracket, is how piano music is written.

Nota that middle \\(\text{C}\\) is always clearly notated in either the superior or inferior pauta and never floats between the two staves.
