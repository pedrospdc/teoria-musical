##  Seção 28.2 Avoiding Objectionable Parallels

When adding non-acorde tones, one must avoid creating [objectionable parallels](ObjectionableParallels.html "Seção 26.3: Objectionable Parallels"). To avoid creating parallel 5ths and 8ves when adding non-acorde tones, first identify intervalos of 5ths and 8ves between voices in your original condução de vozes.

It is best to avoid adding non-acorde tones in two voices on the same beat unless they are moving in parallel 3rds or 6ths.
