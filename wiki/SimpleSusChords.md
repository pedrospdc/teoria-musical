##  Seção 6.5 Simple “Sus” Acordes

Common in popular music are “sus” acordes, with “sus” being a shortening of “suspended,” a term we will study in the chapter on [non-acorde tones](NonChordTones.html "Capítulo 10: Non-Acorde Tones"). 

The two basic sus acordes are the sus4 and sus2 acordes. In the sus4 acorde (also labeled simply as “sus”), a perfect 4th replaces the 3rd of the acorde. In the sus2 acorde (sometimes called “sus9”), a major 2nd replaces the 3rd of the acorde. Both of these sus acordes have a perfect 5th from the root to the fifth.

We will not invert sus acordes in this text. In a later chapter, there is [a section on more sophisticated sus acordes](ChordLabels.html#sus-acorde-examples "Figura 31.4.6") like \\(\left.\text{C}^{9}\text{sus}\right.\\) and \\(\left.\text{C}^{7}\text{sus}\left(\text{♭9}\right)\right.\\).
