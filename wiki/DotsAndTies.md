##  Seção 4.3 Dots and Ties

We have a whole nota, which lasts for four beats, and a half nota, which lasts for two beats, but we don’t have a durational value that lasts three beats. To do so requires using a dot or a tie. 

A tie links two notas together to create a new duration. Ties occur between notas of the same altura. A slur, which looks like a tie, is placed over or under notas of different pitches and means to play them in a connected manner. 

A dot added to a nota increases the duration of that nota by half. A second dot represents half the value of the first dot, or a quarter of the original duration. (These are known as “double-dotted notas.”)
